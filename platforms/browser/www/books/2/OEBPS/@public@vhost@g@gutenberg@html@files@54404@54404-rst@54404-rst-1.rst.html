<div class="document" id="mehalah"><p class="pnext"><span>Another flash, report, and a bullet struck and
splintered the bulwark.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>De Witt rose, resumed the oars, and rowed lustily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah had not stirred.  She had remained erect
in the stern and never flinched.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Coward!' she cried in a voice full of wrath and
scorn, 'I defy you to death, be you who you may!'</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>The examination of old Abraham before George De
Witt did not lead to any satisfactory result.  The
young man was unable to throw light on the mystery.
He had not been with the shepherd all the while since
the sale of the sheep; nor had he seen the money.
Abraham had indeed told him the sum for which he
had parted with the flock, and in so doing had chinked
the bag significantly.  George thought it was impossible
for the shot and pennypieces that had been found in
the pouch to have produced the metallic sound he had
heard.  Abraham had informed him of the sale in
Colchester.  Then they had separated, and the shepherd had
left the town before De Witt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The young man had overtaken him at the public-house
called the Red Lion at Abberton, half-way between
Colchester and his destination.  He was drinking a
mug of beer with some seafaring men; and they
proceeded thence together.  But at the Rose, another
tavern a few miles further, they had stopped for a glass
and something to eat.  But even there De Witt had
not been with the old man all the while, for the
landlord had called him out to look at a contrivance he had
in his punt for putting a false keel on her; with a bar,
after a fashion he had seen among the South Sea
Islanders when he was a sailor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The discussion of this daring innovation had lasted
some time, and when De Witt returned to the tavern,
he found Abraham dozing, if not fast asleep, with his
head on the table, and his money bag in his hand.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is clear enough,' said the widow, 'that the money
was stolen either at the Lion or at the Rose.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I brought the money safe here,' said Abraham
sullenly.  'It is of no use your asking questions, and
troubling my head about what I did here and there.  I
was at the Woolpack at Colchester, at the Lion at
Abberton, and lastly at the Rose.  But I tell you I
brought the money here all safe, and laid it there on
that table every penny.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How can you be sure of that, Abraham?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I say I know it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But Abraham, what grounds have you for such
assurance?  Did you count the money at the Rose?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't care what you may ask or say.  I brought
the money here.  If you have lost it, or it has been
bewitched since then, I am not to blame.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Abraham, it must have been stolen on the road.
There was no one here to take the money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is nothing to me.  I say I laid the money all
right there!'  He pointed to the table.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You may go, Abraham,' said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you charge me with taking the money?' the
old man asked with moody temper.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Of course not,' answered the girl.  'We did not
suspect you for one moment.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then whom do you lay it on?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We suspect some one whom you met at one of
the taverns.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I tell you,' he said with an oath, 'I brought the
money here.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You cannot prove it,' said De Witt; 'if you have
any reasons for saying this, let us hear them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have no reasons,' answered the shepherd, 'but I
know the truth all the same.  I never have reasons, I
do not want to have them, when I know a fact.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Did you shake the bag and make the money chink
on the way?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not answer any more questions.  If you
suspect me to be the thief, say so to my face, and don't
go ferriting and trapping to ketch me, and then go
and lay it on me before a magistrate.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You had better go, Abraham.  No one disputes
your perfect honesty,' said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But I will not go, if anyone suspects me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We do not suspect you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then why do you ask questions?  Who asks
questions who don't want to lay a wickedness on
one?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go off to bed, Abraham,' said widow Sharland.
'We have met with a dreadful loss, and the Almighty
knows how we are to come out of it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man went forth grumbling imprecations
on himself if he answered any more questions.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well,' asked Mehalah of De Witt, when the shepherd
was gone, 'what do you think has become of the
money?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I suppose he was robbed at one of the taverns.  I
see no other possible way of accounting for the loss.
The bag was not touched on the table from the moment
Abraham set it down till you opened it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No.  My mother was here all the time.  There
was no one else in the room but Elijah Rebow.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He is out of the question,' said De Witt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Besides, my mother never left her seat whilst he
was here.  Did you, mother?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What are we to do?' she asked; 'we have no
money now for the rent; and that must be paid next
Thursday.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you none at all?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'None but a trifle which we need for purchases
against the winter.  There was more in the bag than
was needed for the rent, and how we shall struggle
through the winter without it, heaven alone can tell.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You have no more sheep to sell?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'None but ewes, which cannot be parted with.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Nor a cow?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It would be impossible for us to spare her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then I will lend you the money,' said George.  'I
have something laid by, and you shall have what you
need for the rent out of it.  Mehalah will repay me
some day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will, George!  I will!' said the girl vehemently,
and her eyes filled.  She took the two hands of her
lover in her own, and looked him full in the face.  Her
eyes expressed the depth of her gratitude which her
tongue could not utter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now that is settled,' said De Witt, 'let us talk of
something else.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come along, George,' said Mehalah, hastily,
interrupting him.  'If you want to be put across on Fresh
Marsh, you must not stay talking here any longer.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'All right, Glory!  I am ready to go with you,
anywhere, to the world's end.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As she drew him outside, she whispered, 'I was
afraid of your speaking about the two shots to-night.
I do not wish my mother to hear of that; it would
alarm her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But I want to talk to you about them,' said De
Witt.  'Have you any notion who it was that fired at
us?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you?' asked Mehalah, evading an answer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have a sort of a notion.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'So have I.  As I was going down the Rhyn to
fetch you, I was stopped by Elijah Rebow.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, what did he want?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He wanted me to take some curlew he had shot;
but that was not all, he tried to prevent my going on.
He said that I ought not to be on the water at night
alone.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He was right.  He knew a thing or two.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He did not like my going to Merseaâ€”to you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I dare say not.  He knew what was in the wind.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you mean, George?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He tried to prevent your going on?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, he did, more than once.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then he is in it.  I don't like Elijah, but I did
not think so badly of him as that.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you mean, George?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As they talked they walked down the meadow to
the saltings.  They were obliged to go slowly and
cautiously.  The tide had fallen rapidly, and left the
pools brimming.  Every runnel was full of water racing
out with the rush of a mill stream.  'You see, Glory,
the new captain of the coastguard has been giving a
deal of trouble lately.  He has noticed the single-flashing
from the Leather Bottle at the city, and has guessed
or found out the key; so he has been down there
flashing false signals with a lanthorn.  By this means he
has brought some of the smugglers very neatly into
traps he has laid for them.  They are as mad as devils,
they swear he is taking an unfair advantage of them,
and that they will have his life for it.  That is what
I have heard whispered; and I hear a great many
things.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, George! have you not warned him?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I! my dear Glory! what can I do?  He knows
he is in danger as well as I.  It is a battle between
them, and it don't do for a third party to step between.
That is what we have done to-night, and near got
knocked over for doing it.  Captain Macpherson is about,
night and day.  There never was a fellow more wide
awake, at least not on this station.  What do you think
he did the other day?  A vessel came in, and he
overhauled her, but found nothing; he sought for some
barrels drawn along attached behind her, below water
level, but couldn't find them.  As he was leaving, he
just looked up at the tackling.  "Halloo!" said he to
the captain, "your cordage is begun to untwist, suppose
I have your old ropes and give you new?"  He sent a
man aloft, and all the ropes were made of twisted
tobacco.  Now, as you may suppose, the smugglers don't
much like such a man.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But, George, he would hardly go about at night
with a lanthorn in his boat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is what he doesâ€”only it is a dark lanthorn,
and with it he flashes his signals.  That is what makes
the men so mad.  It is not my doctrine to shoot a man
who does his duty.  If a man is a smuggler let him do
his duty as one.  If he is a coastguard, let him do his
duty by the revenue.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But, George! if he were out watching for smugglers,
he would not have carried his light openly.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He might have thought all was safe in the Rhyn.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then again,' pursued Mehalah, 'I spoke, and there
was a second shot after that.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Whoever was there waiting for the captain may
have thought you were a boy.  I do not believe the shot
was at you, but at me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But I held the light up.  It would have been seen
that I was a woman.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Not a bit.  All seen would be your cap and jersey,
which are such as sailor boys wear.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah shook her head thoughtfully and somewhat
doubtfully, and paced by the side of De Witt.
She did not speak for some time.  She was not satisfied
with his explanation, but she could not state her reasons
for dissatisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently she said, 'Do you think that it was Rebow
who fired?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, of course I do not.  He knew you were out,
and with a light; and he knows your voice.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But you said he was in the plot.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I said that I supposed he knew about it; he
knew that there were men out in punts waiting for the
captain, he probably knew that there was some fellow
lurking in the Rhyn; but I did not say that he would
shoot the captain.  I do not for a moment suppose he
would.  He is not greatly affected by his vigilance.
He gets something out of the trade, but not enough to
be of importance to him.  A man of his means would
not think it worth his while to shoot an officer.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then you conjecture that he warned me, and went home.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is most likely, I would have done the same;
nay more, I would not have let you go on, if I knew
there were fellows about this night with guns on the
lookout.  He did not dare to speak plainly what he knew,
but he gave you a broad hint, and his best advice, and
I admire and respect him for it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You and Rebow are cousins?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'His father's sister is my mother.  The land and
money all went to Elijah's father who is now dead, and
is now in Elijah's hands.  My mother got nothing.  The
family were angry with her for marrying off the land
on to the water.  But you see at Red Hall she had
lived, so to speak, half in and half out of the sea; she
took to one element as readily as to the other.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can trace little resemblance in your features, but
something in your voice.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now, Glory!' said the young man, 'here is the
boat.  How fast the tide ebbs here!  She is already
dry, and we must shove her down over the grass
and mud till she floats.  You step in, I will run her
along.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The wind had risen, and was wailing over the
marshes, sighing among the harsh herbage, the
sea-lavender, sovereign wood, and wild asparagus.  Not a
cloud was visible.  The sky was absolutely unblurred
and thick besprint with stars.  Jupiter burned in the
south, and cast a streak of silver over the ebbing
waters.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The young people stood silent by each other for a
moment, and their hearts beat fast.  Other matters had
broken in on and troubled the pleasant current of their
love; but now the thought of these was swept aside, and
their hearts rose and stretched towards each other.  They
had known each other for many years, and the friendship
of childhood had insensibly ripened in their hearts to
love.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have not properly thanked you, George, for the
promise of help in our trouble.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Nor I, Mehalah, for the medal you have given me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Promise me, George, to wear it ever.  It saved your
life to-night, I doubt not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What!  Does it save from death?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'From sudden death,' answered Mehalah.  'I told
you so before, in the boat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I forgot about it, Glory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will tell you now all about it, my friend.  The
charm belonged to my mother's mother.  She, as I
daresay you have heard, was a gipsy.  My grandfather
fell in love with her and married her.  He was a
well-to-do man, owning a bit of land of his own; but he
would go to law with a neighbour and lost it, and it
went to the lawyer.  Well, my grandmother brought the
charm with her, and it has been in the family ever
since.  It had been in the gipsy family of my
grandmother time out of mind, and was lent about when any
of the men went on dangerous missions.  No one who
wears it can die a sudden death from violenceâ€”that
is'â€”Mehalah qualified the assertion, 'on land.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It does not preserve one on the water then?' said
George, with an incredulous laugh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I won't say that.  It surely did so to-night.  It
saves from shot and stab.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Not from drowning?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I think not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must get a child's caul, and then I shall be
immortal.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't joke, George,' said Mehalah gravely.  'What
I say is true.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory!' said De Witt, 'I always thought you looked
like a gipsy with your dark skin and large brown eyes,
and now from your own lips comes the confession that
you are one.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is none of the blood in my mother,' said she,
'she is like an ordinary Christian.  I fancy it jumps a
generation.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, then, you dear gipsy, here is my hand.  Tell
my fortune.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot do that.  But I have given you a gipsy
charm against evil men and accidents.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Hark!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Out of the clear heaven was heard plaintive whistles,
loud, high up, inexpressibly weird and sad,
'Ewe! ewe! ewe!'  They burst shrilly on the ears, then became
fainter, then burst forth again, then faded away.  It
was as though spirits were passing in the heavens
wailing about a brother sprite that had flickered into
nothingness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The curlew are in flight.  What is the matter,
Mehalah?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl was shivering.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Are you cold!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George! those are the Seven Whistlers.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They are the long-beaked curlew going south.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They are the Seven Whistlers, and they mean death
or deathlike woe.  For God's sake, George,' she threw
her arms round him, 'swear, swear to me, never to lay
aside the medal I have given you, but to wear it night
and day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There!  Glory, I swear it.'</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The rent-paying day was bright and breezy.  The tide
was up in the morning, and Mehalah and her mother in
a boat with sail and jib and spritsail flew before a
north-east wind down the Mersea Channel, and doubling
Sunken Island, entered the creek which leads to Salcot
and Virley, two villages divided only by a tidal stream,
and connected by a bridge.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The water danced and sparkled, multitudes of birds
were on the wing, now dipping in the wavelets, now
rising and shaking off the glittering drops.  A high
sea-wall hid the reclaimed land on their left.  Behind it
rose the gaunt black structure of a windmill used for
pumping the water out of the dykes in the marsh.  It
was working now, the great black arms revolving in the
breeze, and the pump creaking as if the engine groaned
remonstrances at being called to toil on such a bright
day.  A little further appeared a tiled roof above the wall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is Red Hall,' said Mehalah, as she ran the
boat ashore and threw out the anchor.  'I have brought
the stool, mother,' she added, and helped the old woman
to land dry-footed.  The sails were furled, and then
Mehalah and her mother climbed the wall and descended
into the pastures.  These were of considerable extent,
reclaimed saltings, but of so old a date that the brine
was gone from the soil, and they furnished the best feed
for cattle anywhere round.  Several stagnant canals or
ditches intersected the flat tract and broke it into islands,
but they hung together by the thread of sea-wall, and
the windmill drained the ditches into the sea.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the midst of the pasture stood a tall red-brick
house.  There was not a tree near it.  It rose from the
flat like a tower.  The basement consisted of cellars
above ground, and there were arched entrances to these
from the two ends.  They were lighted by two small
round windows about four feet from the ground.  A
flight of brick stairs built over an arch led from a paved
platform to the door of the house, which stood some six
feet above the level of the marsh.  The house had
perhaps been thus erected in view of a flood overleaping
the walls, and converting the house for a while into an
island, or as a preventive to the inhabitants against ague.
The sea-walls had been so well kept that no tide had
poured over them, and the vaults beneath served partly
as cellars, and being extensive, were employed with
the connivance of the owner as a storeplace for run
spirits.  The house was indeed very conveniently situated
for contraband trade.  A 'fleet' or tidal creek on either
side of the marsh allowed of approach or escape by the
one when the other was watched.  Nor was this all.
The marsh itself was penetrated by three or four
ramifications of the two main channels, to these the sea-wall
accommodated itself instead of striking across them, and
there was water-way across the whole marsh, so that if
a boat were lifted over the bank on one side, it could be
rowed across, again lifted, and enter the other channel,
before a pursuing boat would have time to return to and
double the spit of land that divided the fleets.  The
windmill which stood on this spit was in no favour with
the coastguard, for it was thought to act the double
purpose of pump and observatory.  The channel south
of these marshes, called the Tollesbury Fleet, was so full
of banks and islets as to be difficult to navigate, and
more than once a revenue boat had got entangled and
grounded there, when in pursuit of a smuggled cargo,
which the officers had every reason to believe was at that
time being landed on the Red Hall marshes, and carted
into Salcot and Virley with the farmer's horses.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The house was built completely of brick, the
windows were of moulded brick, mullions and drip stone,
and the roof was of tile.  How the name of Red Hall
came to be given it, was obvious at a glance.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Round the house was a yard paved with brick, and
a moat filled with rushes and weed.  There were a few
low outhouses, stable, cowsheds, bakehouse, forming a
yard at the back, and into that descended the stair
from the kitchen-door over a flying arch, like that in
front.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Perhaps the principal impression produced by the
aspect of Red Hall on the visitor was its solitariness.
The horizon was bounded by sea wall; only when the
door was reached, which was on a level with the top of
the mound, were the glittering expanse of sea, the
creeks, and the woods on Mersea Island and the
mainland visible.  Mehalah and her mother had never been
at Red Hall before, and though they were pretty familiar
with the loneliness of the marshes, the utter isolation
of this tall gaunt house impressed them.  The thorn-trees
at the Ray gave their farm an aspect of snugness
compared with this.  From the Ray, village-church
towers and cultivated acres were visible, but so long as
they were in the pasture near the Hall, nothing was to
be seen save a flat tract of grass land intersected with
lines of bulrush, and bounded by a mound.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Several cows and horses were in the pasture, but no
human being was visible.  Mehalah and her mother
hesitated before ascending the stair.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is the queerest place for a Christian to live in
I ever saw,' said the widow.  'Look there, Mehalah,
there is a date on the door, sixteen hundred and
thirty-six.  Go up and knock.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you see that little window in the sea face of the
house, mother?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.  There is none but it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can tell you what that is for.  It is to signal
from with a light.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't doubt it.  Go on.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah slowly ascended the stair; it was without
a balustrade.  She struck against the door.  The door
was of strong plank thickly covered with nails, and the
date of which the widow had spoken was made with
nail-heads at the top.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her knock met with no response, so she thrust the
door open and entered, followed by her mother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The room she stepped into was large and low.  It
was lighted by but one window to the south, fitted with
lead lattice.  The floor was of brick, for the cellarage
was vaulted and supported a solid basement.  There
was no ceiling, and the oak rafters were black with age
and smoke.  The only ornaments decorating the walls
were guns and pistols, some of curious foreign make.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The fire-place was large; on the oak lintel was cut
deep the inscription:â€”</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 1em">
</div>
<p class="center pfirst"><span>'WHEN I HOLD (1636) I HOLD FAST.'</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Mehalah had scarce time to notice all this, when a
trap-door she had not observed in the floor flew up, and
the head, then the shoulders, and finally the entire body,
of Elijah Rebow emerged from the basement.  Without
taking notice of his tenants, he leisurely ran a stout
iron bolt through a staple, making fast the trap at the
top, then he did the same with a bolt at the bottom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the time, this conduct struck Mehalah as singular.
It was as though Rebow were barring a door from within
lest he should be broken in on from the cellar.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah slowly drew a leather armchair over the trap-door,
and seated himself in it.  The hole through which
he had ascended was near the fire-place, and now that
he sat over it he occupied the ingle nook.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, Glory!' said he suddenly, addressing Mehalah.
'So you have </span><em class="italics">not</em><span> brought the rent.  You have come
with your old mother to blubber and beg compassion
and delay.  I know it all.  It is of no use.  Tears
don't move me, I have no pity, and I grant no delay.
I want my money.  Every man does.  He wants his
money when it's due.  I calculated on it, I've a debt
which I shall wipe off with it, so there; now no excuses,
I tell you they won't do.  Sheer off.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Master Rebowâ€”' began the widow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You may save your speech,' said Elijah, cutting
her short.  'Faugh! when I've been down there.'â€”he
pointed with his thumb towards the cellarâ€”'I need a
smoke.'  He drew forth a clay pipe and tobacco-box and
leisurely filled the bowl.  Whilst he was lighting his
pipe at the hearth, where an old pile was smouldering,
and emitting an odour like gunpowder, Mehalah drew a
purse from her pocket and counted the amount of the
rent on the table.  Rebow did not observe her.  He was
engaged in making his pipe draw, and the table was
behind the chair.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well!' said he, blowing a puff of smoke, and chuckling,
'I fancy you are in a pretty predicament.  Read
that over the fire, cut yonder, do you see?  "When I
hold, I hold fast."  I didn't cut that, but my fore-elders
did, and we all do that.  Why, George De Witt's
mother thought to have had some pickings out of the
marsh, she did, but my father got hold of it, and he
held fast.  He did not let go a penny; no, not a
farthing.  It is a family characteristic.  It is a family
pleasure.  We take a pride in it.  I don't care what it
is, whether it is a bit of land, or a piece of coin, or a
girl, it is all the same, and I think you'll find it is so
with me.  Eh!  Glory!  When I hold, I hold fast.'  He
turned in his chair and leered at her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There, there,' said she, 'lay hold of your rent, and
hold fast till death.  We want none of it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is that?' exclaimed Rebow, starting out of
his seat, 'What money is that?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The rent,' said Mehalah; she stood erect beside
the table in her haughty beauty, and laughed at the
surprised and angry expression that clouded Rebow's
countenance.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I won't take it.  You have stolen it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Master Rebow,' put in the widow, 'the money is
yours; it is the rent, not a penny short.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where did you get the money?' he asked with a
curse.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You bid me bring the money on rent-day, and there
it is,' said Mehalah.  'But now I will ask a question,
and I insist on an answer.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh! you insist, do you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I insist on an answer,' repeated the girl.  'How
did you come to think we were without money?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Suppose I don't choose to answer.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you don'tâ€”' she began, then hesitated.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will tell you,' he said, sulkily.  'Abraham Dowsing,
your shepherd, isn't dumb, I believe.  He talks,
he does, and has pretty well spread the news all round
the country how he was robbed of his money at the
Rose.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Abraham has never said anything of the sort.  He
denies that he was robbed.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then he says he is accused of being robbed, which
is the same.  I suppose the story is true.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is quite true, Master Rebow,' answered the widow.
'It was a terrible loss to us.  We had sold all the sheep
we could sell.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh! a terrible loss, indeed!' scoffed the man.
'You are so flush of money, that a loss of ten or fifteen,
or may be twenty pounds is nought to you.  You have
your little store in one of those cupboards in every
corner of the old house, and you put your hand in, and
take out what you like.  You call yourself poor, do you,
and think nothing of a loss like this?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We are very poor,' said the widow; 'Heaven knows
we have a hard battle to fight to make both ends meet,
and to pay our rent.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't believe it.  You are telling me lies.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He took the coin, and counted it; his dark brow
grew blacker; and he ground his teeth.  Once he raised
his wolfish eyes and glared on Mehalah.  'That guinea
is bad,' he said, and he threw it on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It rings like a good one,' answered the girl, 'pick
it up and give it to me.  I will let you have another in
its place.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh ho! your pocket is lined with guineas, is it?
I will raise the rent of the Ray.  I thought as much,
the land is fatter than mine on this marsh.  You get
the place dirt cheap.  I'll raise the rent ten pounds.
I'll raise it twenty.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Master Rebow!' pleaded the widow, 'the Ray won't
allow us to pay it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do not put yourself out, mother,' said Mehalah,
'we have a lease of twenty-one years; and there are
seven more years to run, before Rebow can do what he
threatens.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, you are clever, you are, Glory! cursed clever.
Now look here, Mistress Sharland, I'm going to have a
rasher, and it's about dinner time, stop and bite with
me; and that girl there, she shall bite too.  You can't
be back till evening, and you'll be perished with
hunger.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Thank you, master,' answered the widow eagerly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And I'll give you a sup of the very primest brandy.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, we must return at once.  The tide will
ebb, and we shall not be able to get away.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That's a lie,' said Elijah angrily, 'as you've got
here, you can get away.  There's plenty of water in the
fleet, and will be for three hours.  I knew you'd come
and so I got some rashers all ready on the pan; there
they be.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You're very kind,' observed the widow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A landlord is bound to give his tenantry a dinner
on rent-day,' said Rebow, with an ugly laugh which
displayed his great teeth.  'It's Michaelmas, but I have
no goose.  I keep plenty on the marshes.  They do well
here, and they pay well too.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will have a witness that I have paid the rent,'
said Mehalah.  'Call one of your men.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go and call one yourself.  I am going to fry the
rashers.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That guinea is still on the floor,' said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have refused it.  Pick it up, and give me
another.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not pick it up; and I will not give you
another till you have convinced me that the coin is bad.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then let it lie.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where are your men?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't know, go and find them.  They're at their
dinner now.  I dare say near the pump.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah left the house, but before she descended the
steps, she looked over the flat.  There was a sort of
shed for cattle half a mile off, and she thought she saw
some one moving there.  She went at once in that
direction.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Scarce was she gone when Elijah beckoned the
widow to draw over a chair to the fire.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You cook the wittles,' said he; 'I'm my own cook
in general, but when a woman is here, why, I'm fain to
let her take the job off my hands.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman obeyed with as much activity as she
was mistress of.  Whilst thus engaged, Elijah walked to
the door, opened it, and looked out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She's going as straight as a wild duck,' he said,
and laughed; 'she is a damned fine girl.  Listen to
me, mistress, that daughter of yours, Glory, is too
good-looking to be mewed up on the Ray.  You should marry
her, and then settle yourself comfortably down for the
rest of your days in your son-in-law's house.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ah!  Master Rebow, she is poor, she is, and now
young men look out for money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You don't want a very young man for such as she.
Why, she is as wild as a gipsy, and needs a firm hand
to keep her.  He that has hold of her should hold fast.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The widow shook her head.  'We don't see many
folks on the Ray.  She will have to marry a fellow on
the water.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, she won't,' said Rebow angrily.  'Damn her,
she shall marry a farmer, who owns land and marshes,
and saltings, and housen, and takes rents, and don't
mind to drop some eight hundred pound on a bit of
a farm that takes his fancy.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Such men are not easy to be got.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, there you are right, mistress; but when you
find one, whyâ€”â€”' he drew his pipe over the inscription
on the fireplace.  'I'm the man, and now you hold
me, hold fast.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You, master!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Aye, I.  I like the girl.  By God!  I </span><em class="italics">will</em><span> have
Glory.  She was born for me.  There is not another
girl I have seen that I would give an oystershell for,
but sheâ€”sheâ€”she makes my blood run like melted
lead, and my heart here gnaws and burns in my breast
like a fiery rat.  I tell you I </span><em class="italics">will</em><span> have her.  I </span><em class="italics">will</em><span>.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If it only rested with me,' moaned the widow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look here,' said Rebow.  'Lay that pan on one
side and follow me.  I'll show you over the house.'  He
caught her by the wrist, and dragged her from room
to room, and up the stairs.  When he had brought her
back to the principal apartment in which they had been
sitting, he chuckled with pride.  'Ain't it a good house?
It's twenty times better than the Ray.  It is more
comfortable, and there are more rooms.  And all these
marshes and meadows are mine, and I have also some
cornfields in Virley, on the mainland.  And then the
Ray is mine, with the saltings and all thereon;â€”I
bought it for eight hundred pounds.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We are very much honoured,' said the widow, 'but
you do not consider how poor Mehalah is; she has
nothing.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah laughed.  'Not so very poor neither, I fancy.
You lost the price of your sheep, and yet you had money
in store wherewith to pay the rent.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Indeed, indeed we had not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where then did you get the money?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It was lent us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Lent you, who by?' asked Elijah sharply.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George De Witt was so goodâ€”â€”'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah uttered a horrible curse.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Tell me,' he said furiously, coming up close to the
old woman and scowling at herâ€”into her eyes.  'Answer
me without a lie; why, by what right did De Witt lend,
or give you, the money?  What claim had you on him?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, Elijah, I must tell you.  Mehalahâ€”â€”'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Here I am,' said the girl throwing open the door.
'Why am I the subject of your talk?'  A couple of
shepherds followed her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look here,' she said, counting the coin; 'there is
a guinea on the floor.  Pick it up and try it, if it be
good.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That's all right,' said one of the men, ringing the
coin and then trying it between his teeth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is the sum due for our half-year's rent,' she
went on.  'Is it not so, Master Rebow?  Is not this
the sum in full?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He sullenly gave an affirmative.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You see that I pay this over to him.  I don't want
a written receipt.  I pay before witnesses.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow signed to the men to leave, and then with
knitted brow collected the money and put it in his
pocket.  The widow went on with the frying of the
bacon.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come along with me, mother, to the boat.  We
cannot stay to eat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You shall eat with me.  You have come for the
first time under my roof to-day, and you shall not go
from under it without a bite.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have no appetite.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But I have,' said the widow testily.  'I don't see
why you are in such a hurry, Mehalah; and what is
more, I don't see why you should behave so unpolitely
to Master Rebow when he fares to be so civil.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Eat then, if you will, mother,' said Mehalah; 'but
I cannot.  I have no hunger,' after a pause, firmly, 'I
will not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, you have a will indeed,' remarked Rebow with
a growl.  'A will it would be a pleasure to break, and
I'll do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The bacon was fried, and the widow proceeded to
dish it up.  There was a rack in the next room, as
Elijah told her, with plates in it, and there were knives
and forks in the drawer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Whilst the old woman was getting the necessary
articles, Rebow was silent, seated in his leather chair,
his elbows on his knees, with the pipe in one hand, and
his head turned on one side, watching Mehalah out of
his fierce, crafty eyes.  The girl had seated herself on a
chair against the wall, as far away from him as possible.
Her arms were folded over her breast, and her head was
bent, to avoid encountering his glance.  She was angry
with her mother for staying to eat with the man whom
she hated.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>During this quietâ€”neither speakingâ€”a curious
grating noise reached her ear, and then a clank like
that of a chain.  She could not quite make out whence
the noise came.  It was some little while before it
sufficiently attracted her attention to make her consider
about it; and before she had formed any conclusion,
her mother returned, and spread the table, and placed
the meat on a dish.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'll go and fetch the liquor,' said Rebow, and went
away.  Whilst he was absent, again the sound met the
girl's ears.  Neither she nor her mother had spoken, but
now she said, 'Listen, mother, what is that sound?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman stood still for a moment, and then
proceeded with her task.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is nothing,' she said indifferently, 'the sound
comes up from below the floor.  I reckon Master Rebow
has cows fastened there.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'By a chain,' added Mehalah, and dismissed the
matter from her mind; the explanation satisfied her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow returned the next moment with a bottle.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is prime spirit, this is,' said he.  'You can't
drink water here, it gives the fever.  You must add
spirits to it to make it harmless.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You have no beautiful spring here, as we have on
the Ray,' observed the widow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Not likely to have,' answered the surly landlord.
'Now sit down and eat.  Come, Glory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not move.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come, Mehalah, draw up your chair,' said her
mother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am not going to eat,' she answered resolutely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You shall,' shouted Elijah, rising impetuously, and
thrusting his chair back.  'You are insulting me in my
own house if you refuse to eat with me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have no appetite.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will not eat, I heard you say so.  I know the
devilry of your heart.  You will not, but I will?  In
his rage he stamped on the trap-door that he had
uncovered, when removing the chair.  Instantly a
prolonged, hideous howl rose from the depths and rang
through the room.  Mistress Sharland started back
aghast.  Mehalah raised her head, and the colour left
her cheek.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh ho!' roared Elijah.  'You will join in also,
will you?'  He drew the bolts passionately back.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look here,' he cried to Mehalah.  'Come here!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Involuntarily she obeyed, and looked down.  She
saw into a vault feebly illuminated by daylight through
one of the circular windows she had noticed on
approaching the house.  There she saw looking up, directly
under the trap, a face so horrible in its dirt and madness
that she recoiled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She won't eat, she won't bite with me,' shouted
Rebow, 'then neither shall her mother eat, nor will I.
You shall have the whole.'  He caught up the dish,
and threw down the rashers.  The man below snapped,
and caught like a wild beast, and uttered a growl of
satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow flung the door back into its place, and rebolted
it.  Then he placed his chair in its former position,
and looked composedly from the widow to Mehalah
and seemed to draw pleasure from their fear.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My brother,' he explained.  'Been mad from a
child.  A good job for me, as he was the elder.  Now
I have him in keeping, and the land and the house and
the money are mine.  What I hold, I hold fast.  Amen.'</span></p>
