<p class="pfirst"><span>Elijah Rebow, in the pride and ostentation of his heart,
had invited the curate, the clerk, Mrs. De Witt, Farmer
Goppin, Reuben Grout, innkeeper of the 'Rising Sun,'
and several others to eat and drink with him and his
bride at Red Hall after the ceremony.  The marriage
had taken place in the afternoon.  The law in Marshland
was flexible as osier—it must bend to man's
convenience, not man submit to law.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt took the management of everything
out of the hands of the feeble Mrs. Sharland.  'You're
not up to the job,' she said.  'It wants some one with
eyes in her elbows and as many legs as a crab.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt was everywhere, in the kitchen, the
hall, the oak parlour.  She had pinned up her silk dress
about her, so that it might take no harm.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There,' said she to the assembled guests, as she
brought in a pail full of shrimps and set it on the table.
'Stay your appetites on them, and imitate the manners
of high society, which always begins with fish and works
up to solids.  I brought them myself as my contribution
to the feast.  Do you, Elijah, hand a wet round:
if the others be like me they are dry.  Marriage, as I
always found it, is a dry job.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is Glory?' asked Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, yes!' exclaimed Mrs. De Witt.  'That is like
you, Elijah, shouting, "Where is Glory?"  Do you
think she is to come here toozling about among the
wittles in her best gown?  She is upstairs getting her
dress changed.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was pacified.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland passed here and there, eager to be
supposed useful, actually getting across Mrs. De Witt's
path and interfering with her proceedings.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can't stand this,' said the fishwife.  'You go
upstairs and see after Mehalah.  I am going to dish up
the pudding.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will take the gravy in the sauceboat,' said
Mrs. Sharland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't get your shivers on at the time, then, and
send the grease over everyone,' advised Mrs. De Witt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There now, Elijah!' exclaimed she, full of pride,
when the table was spread.  'Do look at them dumplings.
They are round, plump, and beautiful as cherubs'
heads on monuments.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is Glory?' asked Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Run up,' said Mrs. De Witt to the mother, 'tell
the girl we are waiting for her.  Bid her come at once
before the gravy clots.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>An Essex dinner begins with dumplings soused in
gravy.  When these have been demolished the flesh
follows.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The guests sat, with black-handled knives and forks
in hand, mouths and noses projected, and eyes riveted
on the steaming puddings, ready to cut into them the
moment the signal was given.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland was slow of foot.  Every step was
taken leisurely up the stairs and along the passage.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'm afeared,' said Farmer Goppin, 'the outer edge
of the pudding, about an inch deep all round, is getting
the chill.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And there is a scum of fat forming on the gravy,
said Reuben Grout, 'just like cat-ice on my duck-pond,
or like mardlins[1] in spring on a ditch.  Had not I
better set the gravy against the fire till the good lady
comes down?'</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="noindent pfirst"><span class="small">[1] 'Mardlins' are duckweed.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>'She is coming,' said Rebow; and then he drummed
on the table with his knife.  Mrs. Sharland leisurely
returned.  She was alone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well?' from Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah is not in her room.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Curse it!' said Elijah.  'Where is she, then?  Go
and fetch her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not know where she is.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She will be here directly,' said Rebow, controlling
himself.  'You may fall to, neighbours.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the word every fork was plunged into the puddings,
and every knife driven into their hearts.  Each
sought who could appropriate to himself the largest
block of pudding.  Then there ensued a struggle for
the gravy, and great impatience was manifested by those
who had to wait till others had well drenched their
hunches of dough in the greasy liquor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow leaned back in his chair, holding knife and
fork erect on the table.  'Why is she not here?  She
ought to be here.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Take some dumpling, Elijah?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I won't eat till my Glory comes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Lord preserve you!' exclaimed Mrs. De Witt,
slapping his back.  'Go on and eat.  You don't
understand girls, as you do calves, that is a fact.  Why, a
girl on her marriage-day is shamefaced, and does not
like to be seen.  In high society they hide their heads
in their wails all day.  That is what the wails are for.
I was like that.  You may look at me, but it is true
as that every oyster wears a beard.  When I was married
to Moses I was that kittle, coy young bird I would have
dived and hid among the barnacles on the keel of the
wessel, had I been able to keep under water like a
duck.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is she?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How do I know?  Never fear; she is somewhere—gone
out to get a little fresh air.  It was hot and
stank in that hold of an old church.  What with the
live corpses above in the pews and the dead ones below
deck, it gave me a headache, and you may be sure
Mehalah was overcome.  I saw she did not look well.
The pleasure, I suppose, has been too much for her.  A
wery little tipple of that topples some folks over.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You think so?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am sure of it.  Have I not been a bride myself?
I know about those sort of things by actual experience.
I've gone through the operation myself.  It is wery
like being had up before the magistrate and convicted
for life.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah was partly satisfied, and he began to eat;
but his eyes turned restlessly at intervals to the door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't you put yourself out,' murmured Mrs. De
Witt as she leaned over his shoulder and emptied his
glass of spirits.  'Girls are much like scallops.  If you
want to have them tender and melting in your month,
you must treat them with caution and patience.  You
take the scallops and put them first in lukewarm water,
working up into a gentle simmer, and at last, but not
under two hours, you toast them, and pepper and butter
them, and then they are scalding and delicious.  But
if you go too fast to work with them, they turn to
leather, and will draw the teeth out of your gums if you
bite into them.  Girls must be treated just similarly,
or you spoil them.  You wouldn't think it, looking at
me, but my Moses, with all his faults, knew how to deal
with me, and he got me that soft and yielding that he
could squeeze me through his fingers like Mersea mud.
True as gospel.  Fill your glass, Elijah; it don't look
hospitable to allow it to stand empty.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When the lady in her red coat entered, holding
triumphantly above her head a leg of boiled mutton,
there was a general burst of delight.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A hunter's dinner!' said Goppin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But where is the bride?' asked Grout.  'I want
to drink health and a long family to her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory ought to be here.  Go up, Mistress Sharland,
and bring her down.  She has returned by this time,'
said Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't think she has,' said the old woman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am sure of it; go and look.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The widow revisited the bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she returned she said, 'No, Elijah; Mehalah
has not come back.  She has taken off her bridal dress
and laid it on the bed, and has put on her blue jersey,
and I see she has taken with her a red cap.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She tore that to pieces.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She has been knitting a new cap this week,' said
Mrs. Sharland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I like that!  She has done it to please me,' said
Elijah, his eye twinkling.  'I loved her in that; and I
hate to see her as she was tricked out to-day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We are waiting for you to carve,' said Goppin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't forget we like fat,' said Grout.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I say,' murmured Jabez Bunting, a storekeeper,
'look at the gravy, how it oozes out; I'm fit to jump at
the sight.  Don't think we eat like ladies of quality,
Rebow.  Give us good large helpings, and the redder
and rawer the better.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Some one,' said Elijah, 'tell Abraham Dowsing to
go on the sea-wall and look out for Glory, and bring
her home.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There's the boy what rowed me here,' said Mrs. De
Witt.  'He is sitting outside on the step, and I'm
throwing him the bits of skin and fat and gristle.  I'll
send him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Really,' observed the Rev. Mr. Rabbit, after a fit
of sneezing, 'the circumstance reminds the student of
Holy Writ somewhat of Queen Vashti.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you mean?' asked Elijah abruptly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No offence, no offence meant,' gasped the curate,
waxing very red; 'I only thought your good lady was
to-day like Queen Vashti.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory is like nobody,' said Rebow, with some pride.
'There never was, there never can be, another Glory.
I don't care who or what your Vashti was—Was she
beautiful?' shortly interrupting himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Did she bring property into the family!' asked Mrs. De
Witt, leaning over Elijah's shoulder and emptying his
tumbler.  'Elijah! you must replenish.  Look
hospitable, and keep the liquor flowing.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I really don't know,' said Mr. Rabbit.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then what do you mean by saying she was like
my Glory?' asked Rebow angrily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I—I only suggested that there was a faint similarity
in the circumstances, you know.  King Ahasuerus
made a great feast—as you have done.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Was there boiled mutton at it?' asked Grout.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I really cannot say.  It is not recorded.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Give me boiled mutton, a little underdone, and I
ask for nothing more,' said Goppin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And,' went on the curate, 'he naturally wished his
wife to be present.  He wanted her to come down to
be seen of his lords and princes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go on!  Damn your sneezing.  Put it off till
you're preaching, and then no one will care,' said
Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But,' pursued the parson, when he had wiped his
nose and eyes, and recovered breath after the fit,
'Queen Vashti refused to come down.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, what did the husband say to that?' asked
Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If he was a sensible man,' said Goppin, 'he cut
into the mutton, and didn't bother about she.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You don't know, neighbour, that it was a leg of
mutton,' said Grout.  'It might have been sirloin.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sirloin!' exclaimed Bunting; 'I wouldn't go ten
yards to taste sirloin.  There's not enough on the bone,
except fat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go on,' said Elijah to the curate.  'How did the
man—king, was he—take it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He dismissed Vashti, and took Esther to be his
queen.  But then,' put in the frightened curate, thinking
he had suggested a startling precedent, 'Ahasuerus was
not a Christian, and knew no better.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you think,' laughed Rebow, 'that I would cast
off my Glory for any other woman that ever was born?
No, I would not.  Let her do what she likes.  She
don't care to associate with such as you.  She holds
herself above you.  And she's right.  She is one the
like of whom does not exist.  She has a soul stronger
and more man-like than anyone of you.  If she don't
choose to come and guzzle here along of you, she's
right.  I like her for it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He flung himself back in his chair and drained his
full glass.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I ask you, Goppin!  Did you ever see the equal
of my Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can't say as ever I did, Rebow,' answered the
farmer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I took the liberty to chuck her under the
chin, and she up with the pitchfork out of my hand,
and had like to have sent me to kingdom come, had not
my good woman been nigh to hand, and run to the
rescue.  I hope you'll find her more placable when you
come to ask a kiss.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah rubbed his hands, and laughed boisterously.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ha!' shouted he, 'that is my Glory!  I tell
you, Goppin, she'd have drove the prongs of the
fork into your flesh as I dig this into the meat,' and
he stabbed at the joint fiercely with his carving
fork.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I dare say,' grumbled the farmer, wincing and
rubbing his leg.  'I'd for my part rather have a more
peacable mate; but there's no choosing fat beasts for
others, as the saying goes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you think of her?' asked Rebow, turning
round with exultation on Bunting and Grout.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She came to my old woman,' said the latter, 'and
asked her to take her in and give her work.  She wanted
to leave you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She did,' exclaimed Rebow.  'And what did your
old woman say to that?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She said she durstn't do it.  She durstn't do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She durstn't do it!' echoed Elijah with a great
laugh.  'That was fine.  She durstn't do it!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No,' pursued Grout, 'without your leave.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And you wouldn't have dared to do it neither,'
turning to Bunting, who shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, you would not dare.  I'd like to see the man
or woman in Salcott or Virley as would dare.  I reckon
there is none that knows me would make the venture.
By God!' he burst forth.  'Where is the girl?  I will
have her here; and I'm cursed if you shall not all
stand on your legs, and drink to her health and happiness
as the most splendid woman as ever was or shall be.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Abraham Dowsing is at the door,' said Mrs. Sharland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come in, and say what you have to say before us
all,' called Elijah.  'If it be anything about my Glory,
say it out.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is gone off in her boat,' said the old man; 'I
saw her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why did you not stop her then?' asked Mrs. De Witt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I stop her!' repeated Abraham.  'She is my
mistress, and I a servant.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is right,' said Elijah, 'if she had taken a
whip and lashed your back till it was raw, you couldn't
stop her.  Where is she gone to?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Abraham drew up his shoulders.  'That's her concern.
It's no odds to me.  But I tell ye what, Master.
Here are you feasting here, and we han't had nothing
extra with our wittles.  I ask that we may eat and
drink prosperity to you both, to her and you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You shall,' said Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Stay,' put in Mrs. De Witt.  'What do you mean,
you old barnacle, you?  Let your superiors eat their
fill first, and then you and the other men shall have
what's over.  That's fair.  I shall manage for you.
Go, Abraham.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The supper drew to a close.  Elijah drank a great
deal.  He was fretted, though he tried not to show it,
by the absence of Glory.  As more spirits were drunk
and pipes were lighted in the hall, whilst the men of
the farm fed in the kitchen, several of those present
repeated their regret that she in whose honour they
were assembled, the new mistress of the house in which
they had met, had not deigned to show herself, and
receive their good wishes and congratulations.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow gulped down the contents of glass after glass.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt had seated herself with the rest, and
was doing her best to make up for lost time, with the
bottle.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah!' said she, 'one or other must establish
the mastery, either you or Glory.  I did think she were
a bit shy at first to come among us; but now the night
is coming on and still she is away.  I don't deny that
this ain't civil.  But then, she has lived all her life on
the Ray, and can't know the fashions of high society;
and again, poor thing, it's her first experience of
matrimony.  She will do better next time.  Let us drink!'
said she, holding up her brimming glass, 'to her
profiting speedily by her experience, and next time we
have all of us the honour of attending at her wedding,
may she do us the favour to respond.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Amen!' said the clerk, who was present.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go out some one, and see if she is coming,' said
Rebow, his dark face burning with anger and drink.
He could not, however, wait till the messenger returned,
but left his guests, and went forth himself.  He mounted
the sea-wall, and turned his eyes down the creek;
nothing was visible.  He stood there, bareheaded,
cursing, for a quarter of an hour, and then went back
with knitted brows.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He found his guests preparing to depart.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go along!' he said; 'I want no congratulations;
say nothing.  Glory and I have a marriage different
from other folks, as she and I are not like other folks,
We must fight it out between us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He waved his guests away, with a rude impatient
gesture.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt roused her boat-boy by kicking him
off the steps—he had gone to sleep there—and then
tumbling on top of him.  She staggered up, tucked
the lad under her arm, and marched off.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If I meet Glory by the way, I'll send her home,
I'll be sure and mind it,' said she to Rebow as she
departed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He went in.  He ordered Mrs. Sharland to go to
her bed.  The charwoman, had in for the day, cleared
the table of all the glasses, save that of Elijah, and
retired.  He was left alone.  He went to the back
door and fastened it.  Glory should not slink home
that way without facing him.  He seated himself in
his armchair, and refilled his tumbler with spirits
and water.  He was very angry.  She had deliberately
insulted him before his guests, defied him in the face
of the principal people of the parish.  It would be
spoken of, and he would be laughed at throughout the
neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The black veins in his brow puffed out.  A half-drunken,
half-revengeful fire smouldered in his deep-set
eyes.  There was no lamp or candle burning in the
room, but the twilight of midsummer filled it with a
grey illumination.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He walked to the door, opened it, and looked out.
The gulls were crying over the marsh, and the cattle
were browsing in it.  No Mehalah was to be seen.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'On my wedding day!' he muttered, and he resumed
his seat.  'On that for which I have worked, to
which I have looked, for which I have thought and
schemed, she flies in my face, she scorns me, she shows
everyone that she hates me!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>His pipe was out, he threw it impatiently away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She does not know me, or she would not dare to
do it.  There is no one in all the neighbourhood dare
defy me but she.  Everyone fears me but she, for
everyone knows me but she.  Know me she must, know me
she shall.  There will be no wringing love out of her
till she bends under me and fears me.  She will never
fear me till she knows all.  She shall know that; by
God!' he cried aloud, 'I will tell her that which shall
make her shrink and fall, and whine at my feet; and
then I shall take her up, and drag her to my heart,
and say, "Ah, ha!  Glory! think what a man you have
gotten to-day, a man whom none can withstand.  There
is none like me, there is none will dare what I will
dare.  You and I, I and you, are alone in the world.
One must submit or there is no peace.  You must learn
to cower beneath me, or we shall fight for ever."'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He went out again upon the sea-wall, but saw nothing,
and came back more angry.  As he stood on his
steps he heard from the path to Salcott a burst of
merriment.  He swore an ugly oath.  Those men, rolling
home, were ridiculing him, keeping his marriage feast
without the presence of his bride!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He flung himself again into his chair, and rocked
himself in it.  He could not sit there, tortured with
auger and love, in the gloaming, doing nothing.  He
emptied the bottle, there was not a drop more in it,
and he cast it in the hearth.  Then he fetched down
his old musket mounted in brass, and getting the vitriol
bottle from the window, began to rub and polish the
metal.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He wearied of that in the end.  His mind could
not be drawn off Glory, and wondering where she was,
and why she had thus gone away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I love her,' he muttered, as he replaced his gun on
the nails above the chimney-piece, 'but yet I hate her.
My very heart is like Grimshoe with love and hate
warring together, and neither gets the mastery.  I
could clasp her to my breast, but I could tear out her
heart with my nails, because it will not love me.'  He
rocked himself in his seat savagely, and his breath
came fast: 'We must work the riddle out between us.
We can get no help, no light from any others; she and
I, and I and she, are each other's best friends and worst
foes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A firm hand was on the door, it was thrown open,
and in the grey light stood Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where have you been?' asked Elijah, hardly able
to speak, so agitated with fury and disappointed love
was he.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have been,' she said composedly, 'on the Ray,
sitting there and dreaming of the past.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Of the past!' shouted Rebow.  'You have been
dreaming of George?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, I have.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I thought it, I knew you were,' he yelled.  'Come
here, my wife.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am not your wife.  I never will be your wife,
except in name.  I told you so.  I can not, and I will
not love you.  I can not, and I will not, be aught to
you but a housekeeper, a servant.  I have taken your
name to save mine, that is all.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is all because you love George De Witt.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George De Witt is dead.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't care whether he be dead or not, you think
that he is your double.  I tell you, as I have told you
before, he is not.  I am.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not listen to more of this,' she said in a hard
tone.  'Let me pass, let me go to my room.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not let you pass,' he swore; the breath came
through his nostrils like the snorting of a frightened
horse; 'I will not.  Hear me, Glory, my own Glory! hear
me you shall.'  He grasped her arms between the
elbow and shoulder with his iron hands, and shook her
savagely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Listen to me, Glory, you must and shall.  You do
not love me, Glory, because you do not fear me.  The
dog whom I beat till it howls with torture creeps up to
me and licks my hand.  A woman will never love her
equal, but she will worship her superior.  You have
shown me to-day that you think yourself on a level
with me.  You have donned again your cap of liberty,'
he raised one hand to her head, plucked off the cap
and cast it on the floor, 'thinking that now you have
taken me before the world, you have broken my power
over you.  You do not know me, Glory! you do not
know me.  Listen to me!'  Through the twilight she
could see his fierce eyes flaring at her, her hair was
disturbed by the hot blasts of his labouring lungs.  His
fingers that held her twitched convulsively as he spoke.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Listen to me, Glory! and know me and respect
me.  I am no more to be escaped from than fate.  I
am mighty over you as a Providence.  You may writhe
and circumvent, but I meet you at every turn, and
tread you down whenever you think to elude me.
Listen to me, Glory!'  He paused, and drew a long
breath; 'Listen, I say, to me.  Glory! how did you
lose your money that night that Abraham Dowsing sold
your sheep?  I feel you stirring and starting in my
hands.  Yes, I took it.  You went out with George De
Witt, and left the purse on the table.  When your
mother left the room, I took the money.  You may
have it back now when you like, now that I have you.
I took it—you see why.  To have you in my power.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Coward and thief!' gasped Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ah! call me names if you like; you do not know
me yet, and how impossible it is to resist me.  You
thought when you had got the money again, from
George, that you had escaped me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Stay!' exclaimed Mehalah.  'It was you,' with
compressed scorn, 'that fired on George and me in the
marsh.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I fired at him, not at you; and had you not
changed the place of the lanthorn in the boat, I should
have shot him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl shuddered in his hands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I feel you,' he said with savage exultation.  'You
are beginning to know me now, and to tremble.
When you know all, you will kneel to me as to
your God, as almighty over your destiny, irresistible,
able to crush and kill whom I will, and to conquer
where I will.  George De Witt stood in my way to you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah's heart leaped and then stood still.  Her
pulse ceased to beat.  She seemed to be hanging in
space, seeing nothing, feeling nothing, hearing only,
and only the words of the man before her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He left Mersea City one night.  He left it in my
boat with me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He paused, rejoicing in her horror at this revelation
of himself to her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you not a question to ask me, "Where he
now is?  What I know of him?"'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>No—she could not speak, she could not even breathe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you remember when you came on Michaelmas
Day to pay me my rent, how you heard and saw my
mad brother in the cell there below?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He paused again, and then chuckled.  'The poor
wretch died and I buried him there.  I brought George
here, I made him drunk, and chained him in my
brother's place, and he went mad with his captivity in
darkness and cold and nakedness.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The blood spouted from her heart through every
artery.  She tried to cry but could not, she strove to
escape his hands, she was unable.  She panted, and her
eyes stood open, fixed as those of a corpse, staring before
her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You lost your sheep,' he went on, with exultation.
'I took them.  I took them to rob you of every chance
of paying me, and keeping clear of me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not hear him.  She cared nothing about
sheep.  She was thinking of George, of his
imprisonment and madness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'At last, when I feared that after all you might
slip from me by means of that cripple at Wyvenhoe, I
did more.  I watched you on New Year's Eve; I
waited for you to go to sleep, that I might fire your
house.  You did better than I had thought, you went
out; and then I set the Ray Farm in flames.  What
cared I for the loss?  It was nothing.  By it I gained
you, I secured you under my roof, by burning you out
of the shelter of your own.'  He swelled with pride.
'You know me now, Glory!  Now think you that
escape from me is possible?  No, you do not, you
cannot.  I hedge you in, I undermine the ground you
tread.  I saw away the posts that hold up the roof
above your head.  You know now what I am,
irresistible, almighty, as far as you are concerned, your
fate incarnate.  And I know you.  I know that you
are one who will never yield till you have found a man
who is mightier in will and in power than you; those
who have fought are best friends after the struggle,
when each knows his own strength and the full measure
of the resistance of the other.  We have had one wrestle,
and I have flung you at every round; you in your pride
have stood up again, and wiped the blood from your
heart, and the tears from your eyes, and tried another
fall with me; but now, Glory, you have tried your last.
Hitherto you fought not knowing the extent of my
power, thinking that I put forth my full might when I
spoke, but that I had no strength to act.  Now you see
what I can do, and what I have done, and you will
abandon the fruitless battle.  Glory!  Glory!  Come
to my heart.  You fear me now, and fear is the first
step leading to love.  Glory!  my own Glory!' his
voice faltered, and his fingers worked, 'I love you
madly.  I will do and dare all for you.  I will live for
you and for nothing in the world but you.  Never till
this day in the church have I so much as held your
hand.  Never till this moment, Glory! have I held you
to my heart, never till this moment have I felt it
bounding against mine, never till this moment have I kissed
those dear, dear lips, as I shall now.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He drew her to him.  He unloosed his hands to
throw his arms round her.  She felt them closing on
her like a hoop of iron, she felt his heart beating like
the strokes of a blacksmith with his hammer; his
burning breath was on her cheek.  He!  He kiss her!
She lie on that heart which had schemed and carried
out the destruction of her George!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She cried out.  She found her tongue.  'Let go!
I hate you as I never hated you before!  I hate you
as a mad dog, as a poisonous adder!  Let go!'  She
writhed and slipped partly away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never till I have held you to my breast and kissed
you,' he said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That never, never!' she gasped.  She got her
hands on his breast and forced his arms asunder behind
her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ha, ha! strong,' he laughed, 'but not strong as
I.'  He gripped her wrists and bent her arms back.  She
threw herself on the ground, he drew her up.  She
flung herself against the chair, crushing his hand
against the chimney-piece, so that he let go with it
for an instant.  She groped about with her free hand,
in the dark, for some weapon, she grasped something.
He cursed her for the pain she had given him, and
attempted again to seize her hand.  In a moment she
had struck him—him the coward assailant, him the
thief, him the murderer—between the brows with the
weapon her hand had taken.  It was a blow with her
whole force.  There followed a crash of glass, then a
sense as of her hand being plunged into fire.  Then
a shriek loud, tearing through roof and wall, loud,
agonised, as only a man or a horse can utter in supreme
moments of torture; and Rebow fell on the floor,
writhing like a worm, with his hands over his face and
eyes.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Day by day Elijah Rebow lay, or sat, in the darkened
oak parlour with his eyes bandaged, a prey to wrath,
pain, despair.  The vitriol from the broken vial had
got into his eyes, and there was reason to fear had
blinded them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was obliged to have the burning balls kept from
the light, but he raged under the obligation.  He
wanted to see, he could not be patient under restraint.
He could ill understand that in all things he might
not have his way, even in such a matter as this.  He
chafed also at having been conquered by Glory.  That
she should have defied and beaten him, and beaten him
in such a crushing manner, cut his pride to the quick.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>None knew how the accident had occurred save
himself and Mehalah.  To the doctor he had merely
said that in getting the vitriol bottle from the shelf, it
had fallen and broken on his forehead.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland remained in as complete ignorance
of the truth as the rest, and her lamentations and
commiserations, poured on Elijah and her daughter,
angered him and humiliated her.  Mehalah had suffered
in mind agonies equal in acuteness to those endured in
body by Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Horror and hatred of herself predominated.  She
had destroyed, by one outburst of passion, the eyesight
of a man, and wrecked his life.  What henceforth for
thirty or forty years could life be to Rebow?—to one
who could not endure existence without activity?  She
had rendered him in a moment helpless as a babe, and
dependent on herself for everything.  She must attend
to his every want, and manage the farm and his
business for him.  By a stroke, their relative positions
were reversed.  The wedding night had produced a
revolution in their places of which she could not have
dreamed.  She felt at once the burden of the responsibilities
that came upon her.  She was called upon by
those on the farm to order and provide for everything
connected with it.  She had to think for the farm,
and think for the master into whose position she had
forced her way.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She hated herself for her rash act.  She hated the
man whom she had mutilated, but more herself.  If by
what she had done she had in one sense made herself
master, in another she had cast herself into bondage.
By the terrible injury she had inflicted on Rebow she
had morally bound herself to him for life to repair that
injury by self-devotion.  Had it been possible for her
to love him, even to like him, this would have been
light to her, with her feminine instinct, but as it was
not possible, the slavery would be inexpressibly painful.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Love will hallow and lighten the most repulsive
labours, the most extreme self-sacrifice, but when there
is no love, only abhorrence, labour and self-sacrifice
crush mentally and morally.  She must bear the most
fierce and insulting reproaches without an attempt to
escape them, she had in part deserved them.  These
she could and would endure, but his caresses!—no! however
deeply she might have sinned against him,
however overflowing her pity for his helpless condition
might be, she could not tolerate affection from the
man who by his own confession merited her profound
loathing.  He had taken an unoffending man, and had
imprisoned him and blinded his reason by cruelty; it
seemed to her as if Providence had used her hand to
exact a just retribution on Rebow by condemning him
to an equally miserable condition.  The recompense
was justly meted, but would that it had been dealt by
another hand!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In one particular she was blameless, and able to
excuse herself.  She had acted without intent to do
bodily harm, and in ignorance of the weapon she had
used.  She had been carried away by the instinct of
self-preservation, and had taken up what was readiest
at hand, without a wish to do more than emancipate
herself from the grasp of the man she detested.  He
had brought the consequences on his own eyes by his
own act.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But though she quite recognised that he had done
this, and that he richly deserved the consequences, yet
she could not relieve her conscience from the gnawings
of self-reproach, from the scalding blush of shame at
having executed a savage, unwomanly vengeance on
the man who had wronged her.  Had her victim been
a woman and a rival, she would perhaps have gloried
in her act; but the female mind is perverse in its
twists and complexion, and it will tingle with pain for
having hurt a man, however little that man may be
loved, when it would plume itself for having done the
same to a woman who has been a friend.  A woman
must think and act rightly towards a man, but can do
neither towards one of her own sex.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah's bosom was a prey to conflicting emotions.
She pitied Elijah, and she pitied George.  Her deep
pity for George forced her to hate his torturer, and
grudge him no suffering to expiate his offence.  When
she thought of what George de Witt must have endured
in the vault, of his privations there, of the gradual
darkening and disturbance of his faculties, and then of
how Elijah had stepped between him and her, and
spoiled their mutual dream of happiness, and ruined
both their lives, the hot blood boiled in her heart, and
she felt that she could deal Rebow the stroke again,
deliberately, knowing what the result must be, as a
retributive act.  But when she heard him, as now,
pacing the oak parlour, and in his blindness striking
against the walls, her pity for him mounted and
overlapped her wrath.  Moreover, she was perplexed about
the story of George's imprisonment.  There was something
in it she could not reconcile with what she knew.
Elijah had confessed that on the night of George's
disappearance he had enticed the young man to Red
Hall, made him drunk or drugged him, and then chained
him in the vault, in the place of his own brother who had
died.  It was Rebow and not De Witt who, that same
night, had appeared at her window, driven in the glass
and flung the medal at her feet.  But was this possible?
She knew at what hour George had left the Mussets'
shop, and she knew about the time when the medal had
been cast on the floor before her.  It was almost
incredible that so much had taken place in the interval.
It was no easy row between Red Hall and the Ray, to be
accomplished in half an hour.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Surely, also, had George De Witt been imprisoned
below, he could have found some means to make himself
heard, to communicate with the men about the farm,
in the absence of Rebow.  Would a few months in that
dark damp cell derange the faculties of a sane man?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah lifted the trap and went down.  The vault
was a cellar not below the soil, but with floor level with
the marsh outside, or only slightly beneath.  It had a
door fastened from within by a bolt, but also provided
with a lock; and there was the circular window already
described.  The shutter had not been replaced, and the
sunlight entered, and made the den less gloomy and
horrible than Mehalah had conceived it to be.  She
found the staple to which the chain had been attached,
away from the door and the window.  It was obvious
how the maniac had got loose.  The chain had been
attached to the staple by a padlock.  Elijah sometimes
unlocked this, when he was cleaning the straw from the
cell and supplying fresh litter.  He had carelessly
turned the key in the lock, and left it unfastened.  The
madman had found this out after Rebow was gone, and
had taken advantage of the circumstance to break out
at the window.  The chain and padlock, with the key in
it, were now hung over the fireplace in the hall,
mocking the inscription below, 'When I take hold, I hold
fast.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah seated herself in the window of the hall,
and took up some needlework.  Elijah was still pacing
the parlour and beating against the opposite walls,
muttering curses when he struck the oak panels.
Presently she heard him groping along the walls for the
door, and stumbling over chairs.  He turned the handle
and entered the hall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He stood before her in the doorway of the darkened
chamber, with extended quivering hands, his head
bowed, his eyes covered with a thick bandage.  He wore
his red plush waistcoat and long brown coat.  His dark
hair was ruffled and stood up like rushes over a choked
drain.  He turned his head aside and listened.  Mehalah
held her breath.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are there,' he said.  'Although you try to hide
from me, I know you are there and watching me.  I am
in the dark but I can see.  I can see you always and
everywhere, with your eyes—great angry brown eyes—on
me, and your hand lifted to strike me into endless
night.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah did not speak.  Why should she?  She
could say nothing that could do either any good.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you put the hot fire to your tongue and
scorched it out as you have put it to my eyes?' he
asked.  'Can't you speak?  Must I sit alone in darkness,
or tramp alone up and down in black hell, feeling
the flames dance in my eye-sockets, but not seeing them,
and have no one to speak to, no one to touch, no one
to kick, and beat, and curse?  Go out and fetch me a
dog that I may torture it to death and laugh over the
sport.  I must do something.  I cannot tramp, tramp,
and strike my head and shoulders against the walls till
I am bruised and cut, with no one to speak to, or speak
to me.  By heaven! it is bad enough in Grimshoe with
two in the shiphold mangling each other, but there is
excitement and sport in that.  It is worse in that
wooden hold yonder, for there I am all alone.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He stopped speaking, and began to feel round the
room.  He came to the chimney and put his fingers into
the letters of the inscription.  'Ha!' he muttered,
'When I lay hold, I hold fast.  I laid hold of you,
Mehalah, but I have not let go yet, though I have
burned my fingers.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was the first time he had called her by her
Christian name.  She was surprised.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah!' he repeated, 'Mehalah!' and then
laughed bitterly to himself.  'You are no more my Glory.
There is no Glory here for me; unless, in pity for what
a ruin you have made, you take me to your heart and
love me.  If you will do that I will pardon all, I will
not give a thought to my eyes.  I can still see you
standing in the midst of the fire, unhurt like a daughter
of God.  I do not care.  I shall always see you there,
and when the fire goes out and only black ashes remain,
I shall see you there shining like a lamp in the night,
always the same.  I do not care how many years may
pass, how old you may wax, whether you may become
bent and broken with infirmities, I shall always see my
Glory with her rich black shining hair, her large brown
eyes, and form as elastic and straight as a pine-tree.  I
shall see the blue jersey and the red cap and scarlet
skirt.'  He raised his hands and wrung them in the air
above his head: 'What do I care for other sights?
These long flat marshes have nothing beautiful in them.
The sea is not here what it is on other coasts, foaming,
colour-shifting like a peacock's neck; here it is of one
tone and grey, and never tosses in waves, but creeps in
like a thief over the shallow mud-flat, and babbles like
a dotard over the mean shells and clots of weed on our
strand.  There is nothing worth seeing here.  I do not
heed being blinded, so long as I can see you, and that
not you nor all your vitriol can extinguish.  Heat
skewers white hot in the fire, and drive them in at the
eye-sockets through all obstruction into the brain, and
then, perhaps, you will blind me to that vision.
Nothing less can do it.  Pity me and love me, and I
forgive all.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He crept past the chimney-piece and was close to
the window.  He touched Mehalah with one hand, and
in a moment had her fast with both.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot love you,' she said, 'but I pity you from
the depth of my soul, and I shall never forgive myself
for what I have done.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look here!' he snatched his bandages away and
cast them down.  'This is what you have done.  I
have hold of you, but I cannot see you with my eyes.
I am looking into a bed of wadding, of white fleeces
with red ochre smears in them, rank dirty old
fleeces unsecured—that is all I see.  I suppose it is
the window and the sunshine.  I feel the heat of the
rays; I cannot see them save as streaks of wool.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah!' exclaimed the girl, 'let me bandage your
eyes again.  You were ordered to keep all light excluded.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Bah!  I know well enough that my eyesight is gone.
I know what you have done for me.  Do you think that
a few days in darkness can mend them?  I know better.
Vitriol will eat away iron, and the eyes are softer than
iron.  You knew that when you poured it on them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I never intended to do you the harm,' said Mehalah
passionately, and burst into tears.  He listened to her
sobbing with pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are sorry for me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am more than sorry.  I am crushed with shame
and grief for what I have done.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will love me now, Mehalah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She shook her head and one of her tears fell on his
hand; he raised his hand and put it to his eyes; then
sighed.  'I thought one such drop would have restored
them whole as before.  It would, had there been sweetness
in it, but it was all bitter.  There was only anger
with self and no love for me.  I must bide on in
blackness.'  He put his hands on each side of her head,
twisted his thumbs resting on her cheek-bones, and her
unrestrained tears ran over them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He stood quite still.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is the best medicine I could get,' he said;
'better nor all doctor's messes.  To listen to your heart
flowing over, to feel your warm tears trickle, does me
good.  In spite of everything, Glory!  I must love you,
and yet, Mehalah!  I have every cause to hate you.  I
have made you, who were nothing, my wife, mistress of
my house and estate, with a property and position above
everyone else in Salcott and Virley, equal to any of the
proud yeomen's wives on Mersea Isle.  I have made a
home for your mother, and in return you have plunged
me in eternal night, and deny me your love.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let us not recriminate,' said Mehalah through her
tears, 'or I should have enough to charge you with.  I
never sought to be your wife.  You drove me into the
position in spite of my aversion to it; in spite of all
my efforts to escape.  You have wounded me in a cruel
and cowardly manner past forgiveness.  You have
ruined my life and all my prospects of happiness.
George——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He shook her furiously.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not listen to that name,' he said through his
teeth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You could bear to hold him in chains there below,'
she answered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You said, Let us not recriminate, and you pour
a torrent of recriminations over me,' he gasped.  'If I
have wronged you, you have redressed all with one vial
of vitriol in the eyes, where man is most sensitive.
With that firejuice you purged away all the past wrongs,
I expiated in that liquid flame all the evil I had done
you.  You don't know what I have suffered.  You have
had no such experience of pain as to imagine the tortures
I have undergone.  If the anguish were all, it would be
enough atonement; but it is not all.  There is the
future before me, a future of night.  I shall have to
trust to someone to do everything for me, to be eyes,
and hands, and feet to me.  Whom can I trust?  How
do I know that I shall not be deserted, and left to die
in my darkness, a prey to ravenous men?  If you loved
me, then I could lean on you and be at peace.  But
you do not love me, and you will leave me when it suits
your pleasure.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, Elijah,' said Mehalah sadly; 'that I never
will do.  I have robbed you of your sight.  I did it
unwittingly, in self-defence, perhaps also in anger at
knowing how cruelly, wickedly, cowardly you had
behaved to me and to another whom I loved.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Whom you love still!' with a cry of rage.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'One whom I loved,' repeated Mehalah, sadly; 'and
I must atone for my mad act as far as lies in my power.
I will stay by you.  I will never forsake you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Listen to me, Mehalah,' said Elijah, with concentrated
vehemence; 'you know what was said—that the
person you loved went out in a boat and was lost.  The
body was never found.  Should the man turn up again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is impossible.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't care for impossibilities.  I live now in a
dream-world where there is no line drawn between the
possible and the impossible.  Should he reappear, what
then?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Still I would remain at my post of duty,' said the
girl, humouring his fancy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The post of duty, not of love,' he muttered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I said duty,' she replied; 'I will never leave that.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>His thumbs twitched on her cheek-bones and worked
their way to the corners of her eyes; she sharply
withdrew her head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He laughed.  'You thought I was going to gouge
your eyes out with my thumbnails,' he said, 'that I was
going to repay you in kind.  No, I was not; but should
the dead return to life and reclaim you, I may do it.
You cannot, you shall not escape me.  You and I, and
I and you, must sink or swim together.  Say again,
Mehalah, that you will stand by me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I promise it you, Elijah, I promise it you here
solemnly, before God.'  She sank on her knees.  'I
have brought you unwittingly into darkness, and in
that darkness I will hold to you and will cherish you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ha!' he shouted.  'At the altar you refused to
swear that.  To love, cherish, and obey is what the
parson tried to make you say; but all you swore to
was to obey, you denied the other, and now you take
oath to cherish.  The wheel of fate is turning, and you
will come in time to love where you began to obey and
went on to cherish.'</span></p>
