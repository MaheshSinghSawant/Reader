<body><h3 id="The_Supernatural_Illumination">The Supernatural Illumination</h3>
<p>With her young child in the cradle, she was sitting in the early evening in a room which looked out upon an open space of ground including the driveway. Save for the child, she was absolutely alone in the house. It was a very thick, starless night, threatening rain. At her back as she sat in the darkness, resting from her labors and thinking that she must get a light and do some sewing, there was a window almost entirely hidden by vines which were allowed to shade that part of the room, there being other windows to furnish light.</p>
<p>Suddenly there flashed on the wall before her a bright reflection of the vine-covered window, the frame standing out clear and distinct as though there were no vines at all. She looked at this reflection with great astonishment a moment, sprang to her feet, opened the door and started out on the porch which commanded a complete view of the entire front of the house and the open field beyond. There was not a sound nor a <a id="Page_155" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="155"></a> sign of anybody abroad. It is asked in the Scriptures if a woman can forget her sucking child, but in this instance she could, for she ran down the road like a wild thing to a nearby house, where she secured the companionship and moral support of a kindly old woman, and returned for the protection of her sleeping infant.</p>
<p>To the present generation these tales of the supernatural would be generally regarded as rubbish. Those who lived in years of maturity a half century ago would hardly be inclined to so classify them. On the contrary, they would regard them as unsolved mysteries existing at the time, often amusing and seldom terrifying. Let those of that era be the judges. <a id="Page_156" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="156"></a></p>

<span class="large smcap">Tales of Rural Lawyers and the Courts</span></h2>
<p>The fact that there are many amusing fiascoes in running through the regular grist of rural court cases should not in any way reflect upon the personnel of the members of the legal bar. The section in which most of the following incidents occurred has been noted for a century for the exceptional ability and commanding personality of its lawyers. But any attorney engaged in general law practice is continually turning up something which, if commonly known, would be regarded as ranking high in the field of humor.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>An attorney, who during his career became widely known throughout the country in general, was for a long time active in practice as a country lawyer in a little town. No case was too great or too little to command his attention.</p>
<h3 id="The_Litigating_Horse_Dealer">The Litigating Horse Dealer</h3>
<p>Among his clients was a farmer who was also engaged in horse trading. It might <a id="Page_157" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="157"></a> perhaps be said that horse trading was his principal occupation. This man was an enthusiast. Any horse he happened to own was a living wonder. He sold horses, but most generally his method was to exchange his own for some other horse, each of the parties of the trade trusting to their wits to get the better of the other.</p>
<p>As this man, whose first name was Oliver, was extremely fluent regarding the merits of his horses, there were frequent cases in which the party of the second part was disappointed. When the new owner would compare the horse itself as revealed to him by actual contact and use, with the glowing recommendations of the dealer at the time the trade was made, righteous indignation would often lead to a demand for satisfaction. In such cases he would receive no consideration whatever and if he had the real genuine spunk of the period, he would engage a lawyer and begin legal proceedings at once.</p>
<p>This was at a time when petty litigation was extremely frequent and encouraged by <a id="Page_158" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="158"></a> the legal profession. Pacifists were not in fashion and those who were too dignified to settle disputes with their fists, would maintain their self-respect by starting a lawsuit. This class of court cases is pretty generally frowned upon at present, as the standards of the legal profession have advanced steadily the past century, maintaining a close parallel with the similar ethical development of the medical profession.</p>
<p>When Oliver became involved in one of these occasional disputes, he would promptly refer the matter to his attorney, who generally managed to extricate him from even the most unpleasant situation. There was one occasion, however, when this eminent attorney was almost inclined not to act.</p>
<p>After an unusually successful horse trade, Oliver one day appeared at his attorney’s office with a rather grave face.</p>
<p>“Saul,” said he, “I traded horses with a man over on Scrabble Hill and he is all stirred up about it. He has put the matter in his lawyer’s hands and thinks he is going <a id="Page_159" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="159"></a> to be able to make out a strong case. What do you think I better do about it?”</p>
<p>The lawyer regarded the matter calmly. It was hardly necessary to ask any questions. The details of such transactions were apt to bear a strong similarity in different trades.</p>
<p>“What can you prove?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Hang it! Saul!” said Oliver. “It isn’t a question of what I can prove; it is what I have to prove.”</p>
<p>The attorney, therefore, although not especially edified at this kind of professional routine, proceeded to give Oliver an outline of the kind of testimony that he should be able to produce to offset the righteous claims of his opponent. Tradition says that Oliver was nearly always prepared to furnish the evidence, having some very accommodating friends and neighbors.</p>
<h3 id="The_Attorney_Who_Scorned_Divorce_Business">The Attorney Who Scorned Divorce Business</h3>
<p>In a certain locality in northern New England there was a journeyman tinsmith who was nearing his thirtieth birthday. This <a id="Page_160" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="160"></a> young man, although possessed of much natural wit and ingenuity in argument, had never exhibited any desire to better his position. A young girl, of seventeen or eighteen years, aroused his ambition and he decided to study law. His mind absorbed information like a sponge, and by teaching school during the day and studying at night, he was able to prepare himself for what proved to be a very satisfactory examination for admission to the bar. His success was immediate. Marrying the girl who had inspired him to a higher walk in life, he became a brilliant figure in the legal annals of this period.</p>
<p>At the height of his career his wife died, and just as he had never manifested the slightest interest in any other girl prior to his marriage, he was equally indifferent to all other women after the death of his wife. But apparently to overcome moments of black depression which assailed him out of business hours, because of his tense grief at the loss of his wife, he gradually acquired intemperate habits. Then followed a strange record for a thoroughly modern court, of frequent -----File: 164.png—- -----File: 165.png—- <a id="Page_161" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="161"></a> cases called in their regular order, quietly transferred further down the docket list, because of the murmured report of some tipstaff to the judge that “Jim,” who was to try the case, was temporarily incapacitated. Such was the personal regard in which this man was held that there seldom was an instance where an opposing attorney made any objection.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">A TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND ELM</p>
</div>
<p>Not inconsistent with the foregoing history, was the absolute refusal of this lawyer to ever have anything to do with divorce practice. Knowing his contempt for that class of law business, an elderly man one day climbed his office stairs and appeared before the eminent lawyer. There ensued a conversation about as follows:</p>
<p>“Jim,” said the old gentleman, “I have come to see if I can’t engage you to help me get a divorce from my wife.”</p>
<p>The lawyer glared at him and then detecting a humorous twinkle in the old man’s eyes,</p>
<p>“How long have you been married?” said he.</p>
<p>“Fifty-two years,” was the prompt reply. <a id="Page_162" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="162"></a></p>
<p>Lighting a fresh cigar from the stump of an old one, as he was almost a continuous smoker, the lawyer promptly dismissed the matter.</p>
<p>“No, sir; I shall not undertake to get a divorce for you. But you may go home and tell your wife that if she wants a divorce, I will be glad to act for her and it won’t cost her a penny.”</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>The early history of a certain state was associated with considerable difficulty in establishing a distinct separate existence. The early settlers therefore became unusually well informed in the general principles of the juris-prudence of that period. Naturally they did not allow much time to pass after their state organization was assured, before establishing a system of county courts.</p>
<h3 id="The_Murderer_Who_Was_Not_There_That_Day">The Murderer Who Was Not There That Day</h3>
<p>In one of the counties there was all the machinery for carrying on a considerable court business, but affairs were so exceptionally <a id="Page_163" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="163"></a> peaceful that there was very little for the court to do. It was therefore a matter of pride to the inhabitants of that county when it became necessary to try a real red-handed murderer.</p>
<p>The judge had little, if any, experience in murder trials, and felt the importance of the occasion quite seriously. There was great general interest during the trial and the court room was packed. At last the case was ready for the jury which filed out, soon returning with the verdict of guilty. The judge arose and directed the prisoner to stand before him.</p>
<p>“Prisoner at the bar,” said he. “You have been tried by a jury of your peers, and let us hope, superiors, and have been found guilty of the crime charged against you. I therefore sentence you, etc., etc.,” repeating the usual formula, of which the substance was that he should be hanged early in the spring following the present session of court, which was in the late autumn. Then recollecting himself, he said to the prisoner:</p>
<p>“Is there any reason why the sentence should not be imposed upon you?” <a id="Page_164" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="164"></a></p>
<p>The prisoner who had assumed a bored attitude throughout the entire trial, manifested but languid interest.</p>
<p>“I dunno as I have anything to say, except that I don’t expect to be there that day.”</p>
<p>He was not there that day. The jail was a ramshackle affair at best and the prisoner, after apparently enjoying the hospitality of the county during the extreme cold months of the winter, made his getaway a week or two before the date set for his execution, and was never heard from again.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>Perhaps at no time in the history of a certain rural valley was the legal profession more appreciated than it was following a public hearing to, if possible, determine who was responsible for an epidemic of incendiary fires.</p>
<h3 id="A_Celebrated_Arson_Case">A Celebrated Arson Case</h3>
<p>Within a relatively few weeks, several sets of unusually fine farm buildings were one after another destroyed by fire. There was an incipient reign of terror developing. Farmers <a id="Page_165" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="165"></a> all began to wonder who would be the next victim and little else was talked about in local gatherings.</p>
<p>Another fire occurred, and it was decided that something must be done. Finally a public hearing was announced to take place at an early date and an attorney who lived about ten miles distant was induced to act as interrogator.</p>
<p>On the appointed date the hall was filled to overflowing as few who were anywhere within the radius of the fire zone, considered it wise to remain away. One by one those who had been in attendance at the various fires were called upon to give their testimony. Finally a young man was summoned to the stand who it transpired had been present at every fire. The attorney who conducted the interrogation was a noted cross-examiner. It seemed unusual to him that the witness before him should have found it convenient to be practically the first man at every one of the fires. His manner, however, was friendly and reassuring and he asked a great many questions. Within fifteen minutes the audience <a id="Page_166" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="166"></a> were looking at each other and nodding their heads.</p>
<p>“He’s got the right man,” was the verdict.</p>
<p>The attorney, however, was too discreet to indulge in any dramatic accusations. He dismissed the witness in the blandest manner, after which the hearing was halted and a discussion among leading citizens took place. An elderly man of considerable force and personality was deputized to have a quiet conversation with the young man who had just been cross-examined. The result in less than half an hour was a complete confession. The epidemic of fires was over.</p>
<p>It seemed that the guilty man had at the beginning yielded to an impulse to touch a match to a lock of hay which he saw protruding from a barn in the outskirts of the village. The resultant fire and excitement were apparently too much for a brain never any too well balanced. He found the diversion caused by these fires necessary to his existence. He was sentenced for a long term and died in the penitentiary. <a id="Page_167" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="167"></a></p>
<p>The years following the Civil War were productive of a certain type of attorneys who were more effective with the juries of that period than they are apt to be at present. They cultivated eloquence to the limit of their abilities. An attorney who had been an officer in the Civil War acquired quite a reputation as a spectacular pleader. Especially if an old soldier was in any way involved in the case, his oratory reached unusual heights.</p>
<h3 id="The_Attorney_Who_Justified_Assault_and_Battery">The Attorney Who Justified “Assault and Battery”</h3>
<p>An old veteran of two or three wars was on trial at the county court for some form of physical assault. Ordinarily harmless, this old chap would become very pugnacious at times, especially when under the influence of certain fluids. In this case he had done considerable damage to the personal appearance of someone in about his own walk in life and of whom he did not approve. The aggrieved party engaged a lawyer who succeeded in having the case put upon the court calendar for jury trial. <a id="Page_168" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="168"></a></p>
<p>The evidence was very damaging to the old veteran and as there seemed to be no good reason why he should not be taught a lesson, a term in jail seemed extremely imminent, until the attorney for the defense, the officer above referred to, began his argument.</p>
<p>The lawyer was named Johnson, and after making the usual rambling introduction, gradually entered upon a lofty train of thought. He pictured the hero of the two wars as a man to whom the entire community was indebted, and pointed out the fact that even his principal weakness for strong drink was the result of his big heartedness and fraternal spirit. Proceeding with this line of argument he succeeded in convincing the intelligent jury that a man who objected to being battered and bruised by such a hero was not only a poor loser but a pretty cheap sort of man generally. The result was a verdict of “not guilty.”</p>
<p>The old veteran was overwhelmed with admiration for his lawyer’s ability and his enthusiasm promptly found expression.</p>
<p>Turning to his wife, a withered up old woman of about his own age, he said: <a id="Page_169" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="169"></a></p>
<p>“Hurrah! We can now go home and if we ever have a boy, we will name him Thomas V. Johnson.”</p>
<h3 id="The_Lawyer_Who_Was_Going_to_Get_Over_It">The Lawyer Who Was Going to “Get Over It”</h3>
<p>An attorney of unquestioned ability had but one failing and one which was far too common among the legal profession years ago. He was a periodic. At such times his naturally acute business judgment would become rather unstable. Like numerous other lawyers of that period, “Wad,” as he was generally known among his friends, did some insurance business as a side line.</p>
<p>“Wad” was elected to the legislature and immediately took a prominent place. He was an able debater and fluent speaker and exceedingly popular. Coming to the capital city from a week end trip to his home, it was immediately evident that he had been indulging a little too much.</p>
<p>Soon after his return on this occasion Wad wended his way to a certain insurance office to make a series of settlements for collections <a id="Page_170" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="170"></a> he had made in his home town. As soon as the treasurer saw him he recognized the situation, but being personally fond of the man, he hoped to get through with the matter without any complications.</p>
<p>It soon became apparent, however, that Wad was in no condition to settle any accounts. The problems of addition and subtraction were entirely too much for him. The treasurer watched with mingled sympathy and contempt his impotent efforts to group the necessary figures, but finally lost patience.</p>
<p>“You come in some other time, Wad,” said he. “There is no hurry. You can just as well settle this matter some other time.”</p>
<p>The attorney paid absolutely no attention to this suggestion and continued his erratic tussle with the illusive figures. The treasurer who was extremely busy that day, and a model of methodical precision in business details, was thoroughly disgusted.</p>
<p>“Wad,” said he, “you’re in no condition to do business today. You’re drunk. Come in when you get sober and we will settle.” <a id="Page_171" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="171"></a></p>
<p>The exaggerated dignity of the man “under the influence” immediately asserted itself.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m drunk and you’re a d——d fool; I shall get over it and you won’t!”</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>The small town which may perhaps chiefly by reason of geographical location be the county seat, always livens up when the county court is in session. There are always a few cases sufficiently unique to arouse general interest. But there were real thrills at a certain court on one occasion because of the approaching trial of a real genuine bank robber who had been apprehended after he had committed a real crime. The community seemed to some of the inhabitants to be getting thoroughly up to date.</p>
<h3 id="The_Story_of_the_Wily_Bank_Robber">The Story of the Wily Bank Robber</h3>
<p>The prisoner was an up-to-date crook without a doubt. He was a professional and wanted elsewhere, but the court in question was permitted to have the glory of “sending him over the road.” <a id="Page_172" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="172"></a></p>
<p>The trial was a perfunctory affair, and aside from the testimony, which was somewhat exciting in spots, there was nothing to provide any special entertainment for spectators. The prisoner was sentenced for a term of years, and remanded to the county jail to await the convenience of the sheriff before being taken to the penitentiary in another town.</p>
<p>The session of court ended shortly after, and there was no further cause for delay in placing the prisoner where he could put on the stripes. Arrangements for transfer were made to take place on a certain nearby day.</p>
<p>At the county jail it had been noted that the prisoner had been very much cast down by his conviction. He was listless, showing little desire for food and was extremely pale. Before the day set for his removal it became a question whether he would long be able to make the journey. It was therefore decided to remove him at once.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the sheriff, the prisoner, properly handcuffed, was taken to the train, which after a few miles, was to pass through <a id="Page_173" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="173"></a> a stretch of mountain timberland and on a heavy grade. As the train was approaching this wilderness, the prisoner requested permission of the sheriff to go to the wash room. His mildness and apparent natural amiability together with his extraordinary weakness had aroused the personal sympathy of the sheriff. So he promptly removed his handcuffs and granted his desire, taking his own stand by the door, according to custom. On the heavy grade the train naturally went slowly. The prisoner had slipped the bolt as he went in and nothing further being heard from him the sheriff rapped on the door. There was no response. After a few such attempts to arouse the prisoner who had apparently fainted from weakness, it was decided to force an entrance. As may be naturally expected, the window was open and the prisoner was gone. The train was halted and an immediate search was made and the alarm spread far and wide. Nothing was ever heard of the prisoner again.</p>
<p>The mystery of the sudden extreme pallor and weakness was soon afterwards solved. A <a id="Page_174" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="174"></a> search of the cell recently occupied by the prisoner disclosed a couple of wads of so-called fine cut chewing tobacco which those wise in criminal annals promptly connected with the escape. The prisoner had bound these wads of tobacco under his arm pits and it was the absorption of nicotine thus resulting which, theoretically at least, had produced the symptoms which had so aroused the sympathies of the sheriff.</p>
<h3 id="The_Legend_of_the_Pine_Tree">The Legend of the Pine Tree</h3>
<p>The fondness for litigation, especially among certain farmers in olden times, became almost a monomania in some instances. For many years there resided in a tumble-down house on a little farm, a man who with his wife was perhaps as near an approach to poor mountain white as can be found in the New England states. And yet the story had it that he had at one time been a prosperous farmer in one of the most fertile valleys of his state.</p>
<p>According to the legend this man and a neighbor became involved in a dispute as to <a id="Page_175" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="175"></a> the possession of a certain large and lofty pine tree situated on the boundary line of the two farms. The quarrel eventually developed into a lawsuit which was continued from term to term by well-known dilatory tactics of that period. Each of the parties in the dispute had employed able legal counsel. Eventually both of the farmers became bankrupt after exhausting their means in continuing the legal struggle.</p>
<h3 id="The_Man_Who_Wanted_to_be_Sociable">The Man Who Wanted to be “Sociable”</h3>
<p>In another instance a man possessed of the same mania for legal contest had gradually seen his property absorbed by a capable lawyer. To him he always referred his numerous disputes. When the aggressive litigant was unable to pay money, the attorney would arrange for settlement by note. The notes were transferred into a mortgage and finally the mortgage was foreclosed.</p>
<p>At the general windup of affairs certain farm animals, which were a part of the few visible assets remaining, were sold at auction. It might be expected that the belligerent lover <a id="Page_176" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="176"></a> of lawsuits would have been somewhat cast down under those circumstances. But he was game.</p>
<p>At one time, however, it became necessary for the auctioneer to admonish the man who, although afflicted with an impediment of speech, was seen to be in earnest conversation with a prospective bidder. It was assumed by the auctioneer that he was giving out tips as to which cows about to be sold were most desirable. In an aggressive tone, calculated to be heard by all present, the auctioneer called out:</p>
<p>“Look here, Mr. Thomas! You keep your ideas about these cows to yourself!”</p>
<p>The old man turned about to look at the auctioneer a moment, then with a whimsical glance at the spectators stuttered out his response as follows:</p>
<p>“D—d—dammit; can’t a m—m—m—man be sociable?” <a id="Page_177" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="177"></a></p>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br/>
<span class="large smcap">Some Experiences of the Yankee Traveling Salesman</span></h2>
<p>When it gradually dawned upon the country merchant that by dealing via the mails with responsible wholesalers and jobbers of the cities, it might not be necessary for him to spend a week or two several times a year going to “market,” it incidentally became apparent to the wholesalers and jobbers in question that it might not be a bad idea to visit the merchant in his own store and stimulate his ambition to try out new goods of new styles and designs. The result was the development of a very unique type, the traveling salesman or “drummer.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most conspicuous of these tourists was the grocery salesman. It was necessary for him to interview his trade about every thirty days in order to keep designing rivals from stealing away his customers. As there was a profit in the business, the number of wholesale houses increased, and likewise the <a id="Page_178" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="178"></a> number of their representatives. There gradually developed a very intense competition for all kinds of trade.</p>
<p>The commercial traveler was necessarily a man of optimism and usually endowed with a capacity to endure much physical fatigue. It was lively work covering a good, fair sized territory every thirty days. Naturally it became increasingly difficult for a novice to establish himself in the face of such intense competition.</p>
<h3 id="The_Hopeful_Young_Beginner">The Hopeful Young Beginner</h3>
<p>A young man who had acquired roseate views of the possibilities of making a fortune as a grocery salesman, started out to cover a new route. Visiting a group of towns in a certain state, he found the merchants were all exceptionally well supplied with everything he himself had to offer, but with courage unabated he kept on, believing that when he arrived at a nearby thriving town with several active dealers, his luck would change.</p>
<p>Reaching this town on a late afternoon train, he hastened to the most prosperous <a id="Page_179" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="179"></a> grocery store. The proprietor was just about to leave the store to “go to supper.” He, however, paused to listen with a wearied air while the young man introduced himself, explaining that he expected to travel over that territory every four weeks from that time on and hoped to be able to serve him. The merchant finally spoke:</p>
<p>“You say you expect to come here once a month?”</p>
<p>“I do,” was the hopeful reply.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the merchant, with a twinkle in his eye. “I think you ought to do well; there have only been thirteen grocery drummers here today.”</p>
<p>The young man’s enthusiasm was somewhat dampened.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>One of the bugbears of the New England traveling salesman who must cover his route at frequent intervals, is the midwinter blizzard. It often requires a good many card games to fill in the waits. These episodes are not without amusing details, but one of these unwelcome events developed little that was humorous. <a id="Page_180" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="180"></a></p>
<h3 id="The_Sick_Engineer_in_the_Next_Room">The Sick Engineer in the Next Room</h3>
<p>Late one winter afternoon, two salesmen left a nice comfortable hotel in a little town because the path of duty led them to take a narrow gauge road up into the mountains. It was getting dark, had been snowing heavily all day and the wind was just beginning to take part in the program, frisking the feathery snow, here and there, just to show what an innocent thing a winter breeze can be. But when the train had gotten out of the way from the valley town and was making its laborious way up a steep grade into the mountains, the real force of the wind began to be apparent. The cars would rock back and forth on their narrow carriages, but as there was no record that they had ever actually capsized, everything was cheerful enough in the smoking car. After a few miles, progress began to be very slow, as drifts had accumulated on the track. Finally a trainman came through and said that “Jim” was in mighty bad shape and he didn’t know whether he could stick it out to the end of the line or <a id="Page_181" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="181"></a> not. Certain questioning brought out the fact that “Jim” was the engineer who had a high fever and was almost delirious. The air became colder and colder and the wind increased. After several hours, however, the short run of thirty miles was accomplished and the two travelers started for the hotel. It developed, that the hotel was not ostensibly open for business, the proprietor having become peeved at repeated searching parties working in the interest of prohibition. One of the travelers, however, knew the ropes and led the way around through the back kitchen where the low browed graduate of a New York dive, who conducted the tavern, was found and he reluctantly agreed to provide rooms, though they proved to be absolutely without heat.</p>
<p>One of the travelers immediately went to bed, having the foresight to take his fur coat with him for extra covering, but he did not sleep well. The train crew had succeeded in helping the engineer through the drifts to the hotel and established him in a room adjoining that of the salesman. The rooms were communicating and although the door was closed, <a id="Page_182" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="182"></a> there was a wide crack at the top. All night long, under the faithful administrations of the local doctor, the heroic engineer who had stuck to his post and pulled his train through under conditions that would tax all the faculties of a well man, was battling for life. He proved to have an acute form of pneumonia. The night finally passed and the salesman was able to get out of town from which point he went to headquarters in a neighboring city to report. A few days later, being back on the job once more, he saw a funeral cortege coming from the railroad station. They were carrying the body of the engineer.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>To the salesman who visits his trade at frequent intervals, life is chiefly made up of customers and hotels. The amusing experiences which every commercial man has are, however, chiefly associated with his various hotel homes. To be able to establish oneself for the night at a cozy hotel where it is allowable to call the clerk and the head waitress by their first names, provides relief from the intense mental concentration necessary in <a id="Page_183" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="183"></a> bringing various customers around to the salesman’s way of thinking.</p>
<h3 id="What_Happened_in_the_Hotel_Barber_Shop">What Happened in the Hotel Barber Shop</h3>
<p>The salesman who takes frequent trips is, as before stated, eventually in a position to call everyone in a hotel establishment by their first names, the hotel barber being no exception. One such barber became very widely known to travelers because of his genial qualities and quick wit, as well as his efficiency in carrying on his trade. It was only the occasional visitor to his shop who failed to call him “Dan.”</p>
<p>“Dan” not only enjoyed the popularity of the traveling fraternity, but was regarded with high favor by the prominent citizens of the town, most of whom were regular customers. While the atmosphere of the barber shop was cheerful, “Dan” was careful to make sure that there was nothing in that same atmosphere that would be in any way offensive to his more conservative clientele. With unusual skill he was able to give his shop a <a id="Page_184" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="184"></a> somewhat clublike atmosphere which of course helped business.</p>
<p>One day a very discordant element obtruded itself. A well-known, but not greatly admired, local citizen familiarly known to the villagers as “Hen” was having one of his periodical drinking spells. Rambling about in his customary aimless manner under such conditions, he suddenly made his appearance in the shop. A bank president was in the chair and another well-known citizen was “next.”</p>
<p>“Dan” gave a quick glance at the intruder, who obviously had no business purpose in coming there, and detecting his condition at once, he told the inebriate man in bland but decisive terms that he better move along. “Hen” was not in a frame of mind to be reasoned with and showed no intention of moving out. He addressed his conversation indiscriminately to all who might be present, much to their annoyance. But “Dan” was equal to the emergency. Suddenly laying down his razor, he stepped quickly to his overcoat which was hanging on a peg and took from one of the pockets a leather pipe case. Wheeling about <a id="Page_185" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="185"></a> and pointing the pipe case at this astonished intruder, he said:</p>
<p>“You get out of here, quick; or I’ll shoot you right in your tracks!”</p>
<p>“Hen” was no hero, drunk or sober, and he fled in consternation to the other end of the village.</p>

<p>Visiting the country stores of New England in wintertime, often provides startling contrasts in the way of hotels. The traveler who spends Tuesday night at a thoroughly modern commercial hotel in a town of 5000 inhabitants, can spend Wednesday night in a similar hotel, if he is traveling in summer via auto. In winter, however, he may find it difficult to arrange for these comforts.</p>
<h3 id="The_Salesman_Who_Was_Given_a_Warm_Room">The Salesman Who Was Given a “Warm Room”</h3>
<p>A salesman for a western firm who enjoyed the comforts of life, was quite disturbed one evening to find himself in a small mountain village and destined to stay over night at an old-fashioned hotel. This old-time tavern was <a id="Page_186" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="186"></a> one of the oldest buildings in that section of the state and much the oldest of all the hotels of that region. It was built of brick, with small windows and high window sills, the glass being small panes of the Revolutionary period. The sleeping rooms were but narrow cells leading off from a long, dark corridor.</p>
<p>The outdoor temperature was about 20 degrees below zero, and as this hotel had no steam heat, each room being warmed separately, the salesman made a very vigorous demand for a fire in his bedroom. He was promptly assured by the landlord that he should have a fire and a warm room.</p>
<p>Stopping at the hotel was a traveling troop of Indian performers, the male members of which camped out in the old-time dance hall on the second floor. The salesman, who had not slept very well the night before, went to his room early. He found an old-fashioned box stove which was just beginning to throw out a genial heat. He felt very well satisfied with himself that he had made his demands known.</p>
<p>With the door closed, the temperature of the small room soon passed the genial stage. <a id="Page_187" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="187"></a> It became intense. The salesman therefore hastened to open the window, believing that a little 20 degrees below zero air would just about balance the overtime efforts of the stove. He found the lower part of the window sash so thoroughly fixed into a bed of ice that it was immovable. He therefore concluded that if he opened the door into the hall, it would make things about right. This he accordingly did and went back to bed. He was just dozing over when he heard a rustling at the door. He looked out into the dimly lighted hall to see one of the “bucks” belonging to the Indian encampment looking curiously into his room. He therefore concluded that it would be wiser to close the door, as his confidence in the absolute integrity of the members of the troop was not of the Fenimore Cooper type.</p>
<p>Having closed the door, the salesman then attempted to go to sleep, but it was impossible. He arose and opened the stove door and made a careful study of the contents. He found a large green chunk of wood well coaled over and apparently capable of sustaining <a id="Page_188" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="188"></a> an abundance of heat during the night. A high pitcher sitting in an old-fashioned bowl contained some water and the luxury loving traveler succeeded finally in slackening the fire to such an extent that he was able to get several hours sleep.</p>
<p>The hotel was of very considerable interest as a historical landmark, but it can be taken for granted that the picturesque history of this hostelry was not appreciated by the traveling salesman.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>Modern conditions prevail with the country hotels of northern New England at present. Only a few winters ago, however, a salesman who opened a window of his steam heated sleeping room for air and then woke up to find the faucet in his room frozen, was promptly presented with a bill for damages the next morning by the landlord. It may be said, however, that this hotel is not typical. There are numerous country inns throughout New England which are comfortable in the coldest days in winter. <a id="Page_189" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="189"></a></p>
<h3 id="The_Story_of_the_Itemized_Expense_Account">Story of the Itemized Expense Account</h3>
<p>A veteran hardware salesman, named Ed Stone, made two trips a year among his wide circle of customers. He was genial, efficient and popular, and was regarded as a valuable asset by his employers. The oldest member of the firm, quite well along in years, was very prone to petty economies. Looking over some of the travel accounts of several salesmen representing the firm, he came to the conclusion that it would be well to have them itemize their expense accounts. As Ed happened to be at the store, he promptly advised him of the new policy. The salesman who knew the peculiarities of the old gentleman, assured him that it would be perfectly satisfactory to him to make out a detailed report.</p>
<p>Starting out the next week, about one of the first points to be reached was a small city where Ed had always been tolerably sure of a big order. The store was conducted by an old-time merchant who had been gradually pushed into the background by his aggressive <a id="Page_190" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="190"></a> and far less competent son. While there were whispers that the firm were heading in the wrong direction, their credit was still excellent.</p>
<p>So to the young man of the firm, Ed extended the fraternal hand, but soon found that “Tommy,” the son, was not in a genial humor. Business was very poor, he was told. They had plenty of goods and would skip the usual spring order. Further parley seemed to promise no results, “Tommy” showing symptoms of irritability.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ed, “I’m sorry you feel that way, but I cannot see any reason why you should not come down to the hotel and have supper with me tonight. Like enough we will find a couple of the boys there and can have a game of whist.”</p>
<p>After some persuasion, “Tommy” accepted the invitation, appearing at the hotel soon after the store closed, where he enjoyed as sumptuous a dinner as the ingenuity of Ed could devise. Later on they went to Ed’s room, but there is no occasion for any further details, as everything which transpired <a id="Page_191" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="191"></a> can readily suggest itself to any normal imagination by the item which appeared in Ed Stone’s expense account for that day.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“February 26th</p>
<p>To getting Tommy Wilson into a frame of mind so that he would order his usual spring bill of goods.... $20.00”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Shortly afterward Ed Stone’s circumlocutions brought him near enough to the main office so that he ran in over Sunday and handed his expense report to the senior member of the firm. The latter looked it over with great interest for a few seconds and then turned to Ed:</p>
<p>“Why, Mr. Stone,” said he. “What does this Wilson item mean?”</p>
<p>Ed smiled.</p>
<p>“I think,” said he, “I’ll have to leave that to your imagination.”</p>
<p>The old man, who was a good citizen and a church man in regular standing, swallowed hard and said:</p>
<p>“Well! Well! I guess you need not bother to itemize your expense reports any more.” <a id="Page_192" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="192"></a></p>
<h3 id="Two_Barrels">“Two Barrels”</h3>
<p>A great asset to the traveling salesman is individuality, especially if it is of the constructive type.</p>
<p>A bakery and confectionery firm had a star traveling salesman who covered a wide range of territory. Somewhat advanced in years, he gradually became afflicted with an impediment in his hearing.</p>
<p>There is often tragedy in some gradually developing infirmity like deafness, but it did not prove necessary for the firm who employed Henry S—to make any change. They were very well satisfied to let Henry stay on the job year after year, until he became quite an old man.</p>
<p>Henry always could be depended upon to get orders. Of course his success in quite a large measure was due to his friendly personality which made him cordially received wherever he went.</p>
<p>There are tricks in all trades and Henry became famous for one which caused many a smile, not only among the storekeepers, but the traveling profession as well. <a id="Page_193" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="193"></a></p>
<p>Whenever in doubt, because of defective hearing, Henry always assumed that his customer was talking business. A star feature of his line was a certain brand of homemade crackers.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe I need any crackers today, Henry,” said the storekeeper, raising his voice.</p>
<p>“Two barrels, did you say?” said Henry.</p>
<p>The merchant laughed and nodded his head. He knew he could get rid of them sooner or later and Henry was a thoroughly good fellow.</p>
<h3 id="The_Old_Man_Who_Was_Inveigled_Into_a_Poker_Game">The Old Man Who Was Inveigled Into a Poker Game</h3>
<p>In a certain New England town, two hustling citizens bought an old hotel which with certain renovations and alterations, soon became an attractive resort for commercial men. And while new customers flocked to the old hotel, the old rural patrons also proved loyal and the hotel did a thriving business.</p>
<p>One evening three enterprising commercial men began looking about for a fourth partner for the purpose of going into retirement for <a id="Page_194" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="194"></a> a little tussle with the god of Chance; in other words, they were to play poker. No one turning up to take the fourth place, their attention was called to an elderly man with white hair and a long white beard, who seemed to be quite active for his years and, more as a joke than anything else, they invited him to take part in the game. The old gentleman in question lived on a farm and came from a very rural district, therefore according to the usual precedents, he should be expected to gasp with horror at the prospect of being decoyed into a gambling game with three thoroughly up-to-date young travelers. Somehow he did not seem to be disturbed by what the game developed into soon after he had taken his seat.</p>
<p>The traveling men were well supplied with expense money and as they had naturally expected from his moderately prosperous appearance, the old gentleman seemed also to have plenty of funds. The contest lasted far beyond the time when the elderly gentleman with the long white whiskers might be expected to retire to rest, but he did not seem <a id="Page_195" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="195"></a> to be visibly affected by the late hours. The game finally terminated in time to give the commercial men two or three hours of very necessary sleep, after which they had their breakfast, negotiated various small loans to secure expense money and went their several ways. The hotel porter, naturally cognizant of everything that happened in the hotel, tersely explained the entire matter in the following words:</p>
<p>“My Lord! Say, do you know that old chap with the white whiskers? He just cleaned those fellows out of every cent they had!”</p>
<p>To those who knew the “old gentleman,” whose hair became snow white at a little past thirty and who carried that same luxuriant white hair until he was eighty years old, the above incident is but a glimpse of his many sided characteristics. He could be as generous with those who needed friendly sympathy as he could be merciless with those who attempted to overreach him. <a id="Page_196" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="196"></a></p>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br/>
<span class="smcap">Traditions of the Rural Church</span></h2>
<p>The New England pioneers who penetrated the unbroken, trackless forests searching for suitable locations for future homes and who spared no physical effort in establishing these homes, would have regarded with contempt, if not with horror, the present day tendencies toward shorter and shorter hours of labor. For in their dictionary the term “recreation” was practically unknown.</p>
<p>No new settlement could be regarded as fairly established until it possessed a schoolhouse and a church. Naturally this involved much extra labor and personal sacrifice.</p>
<p>So the New England tourist of the present day is constantly finding these little old-fashioned emblems of self-denial tucked away, not only in small hamlets but at the cross roads. The influx of numerous people of different foreign nationalities and of the different religions, has in many instances left the churches a difficult problem, financial and otherwise, to <a id="Page_197" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="197"></a> the limited number of communicants yet remaining of the old New England stock.</p>
<p>Before so many of the younger generation became ambitious for city life and left the home farms to pass into the hands of strangers, these churches were very active centers of culture and uplift.</p>
<p>However, with human nature as it is, it could hardly be expected that there should not be some trying incidents connected with the close intimacies of the country congregation. The new pastor soon found that each of his parishioners had a very distinct individuality which was often calculated to jar upon other individualities of his flock. The nerve strain incident to preserving harmonious relations under these conditions was no doubt responsible in numerous instances for the “nervous dyspepsia” which has so frequently afflicted country ministers.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>In the early days when barter rather than cash was the chief means of exchange, the parson’s salary was necessarily small, at least in actual cash. To make up to him what <a id="Page_198" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="198"></a> they were unable to deliver in the way of real money, the pastor was made the subject of countless acts of generosity in the form of loads of wood, potatoes, pork and various other elements of family subsistence. However, the crowning act of generosity on the part of parishioners was the annual Donation Party.</p>
<h3 id="The_Story_of_the_Raised_Biscuits">The Story of the “Raised” Biscuits</h3>
<p>In a certain parish there was a clergyman whose family did not take very kindly to these rural substitutes for real money. Probably the minister’s wife had “seen better days” before she became the partner of a struggling country pastor. And quite likely she may have expressed her disapproval of the stingy characteristics of some in the parish in the presence of her children.</p>
<p>The annual Donation Party at this parsonage was a great success in point of numbers, but the donations themselves were rather small. Each matron of the community was of course expected to furnish her share of the refreshments. Probably there was not sufficient <a id="Page_199" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="199"></a> team work in the “Ladies’ Aid Society.” At any rate, the pastor’s wife found herself, at the conclusion of the evening’s festivities, in possession of an extraordinarily large number of exceedingly durable “raised biscuits,” the other donations being far below the proper standard.</p>
<p>It became necessary for the pastor and his wife to visit an adjoining town the next day, their children being left behind. During the absence of the parents there were developments which scandalized the entire neighborhood and filled the pastor and his wife with horror.</p>
<p>Shortly after their parents went away the children got busy. The residents of the neighborhood passing the parsonage during the day noted with mingled amusement and indignation the fact that each one of the wooden pickets surrounding the ample enclosure of the parsonage was surmounted by a raised biscuit.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>It was a very hot Sabbath, but the faithful residents of the parish were practically all in <a id="Page_200" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="200"></a> attendance. The parson accepted even the most extreme views of the tense theology of that period. Therefore the faithful mothers of the congregation arose early in order that they might prepare all the children of walking age and upwards to appear in clean clothes and clean faces by the time the last bell stroke was heard.</p>
<h3 id="The_Small_Boy_Who_Scandalized_the_Congregation">The Small Boy Who Scandalized the Congregation</h3>
<p>In accordance with the custom of that period, there were no free pews, except for the extremely poor. The owner of each of these sittings after carefully packing his family away in the limited space available for that purpose, closed the door of his pew.</p>
<p>As before stated, it was a very warm day and little “Jabe,” who for some family reason or other was at present living with his three maiden aunts, came to church attired only in his gingham shirt and cotton trousers. Jabe was not old enough to appreciate the solemnity of the occasion and it was beyond his understanding how people could be so foolish <a id="Page_201" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="201"></a> as to be willing to sit perfectly still for two mortal hours in church. Therefore, when he found that his attendance at church was inevitable that morning, he looked about to provide himself with diversion for the long period of hateful inactivity. The maiden aunts were very devout. They gave their entire attention to the parson. Except to occasionally lay a restraining hand on the “wiggling” urchin who was stationed between them, they seemed to have forgotten him.</p>
<p>In the pew immediately behind little Jabe and his aunts, there were several young girls. Even at this time it was often necessary to frown upon the effervescent spirits of girls in their teens. It can therefore be readily understood how horrified and scandalized were the “pillars” of the church, when in the midst of the service, one of these young ladies squealed hysterically. The minister ceased his discourse and one of the deacons hastily demanded an explanation, which even in that austere congregation seemed to be not only satisfying but amusing. Little Jabe on his way to church, loitering behind his faithful aunts, had <a id="Page_202" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="202"></a> spied a small snake on the roadside, pounced upon it and tucked it inside his little gingham shirt. When the pastor had got well along in “fifthly,” Jabe had taken the snake by the tail and allowed his head to emerge from his shirt front with the above named disastrous consequences to the dignity of the morning service.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>Without doubt the first essential for the success of the country pastor is the diplomatic instinct. He may be lacking in many other ways, and yet continue to retain the good will and support of his parish, provided that he can get in intimate contact with his people without wounding their peculiar sensibilities.</p>
<h3 id="The_Driveling_Idiot">The “Driveling Idiot”</h3>
<p>A well-known clergyman, who was extremely popular in several parishes, tells with much delight, his experience with a certain amiable old lady who received him very cordially one day when making pastoral visits.</p>
<p>This minister was a comparative newcomer in the community and had never had <a id="Page_203" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="203"></a> an opportunity to really make the acquaintance of the lady in question. The conversation covered the normal range of small town subjects, the lady showing very considerable interest in the minister and his prospects and becoming more and more affable as the conversation continued.</p>
<p>Finally it became the proper thing for the minister to gracefully withdraw, which he did despite the urgent protest of his hostess to linger a little longer. As he was about to take his departure, she gave him a most approving look and dismissed him with the following words:</p>
<p>“I am so glad we have had this little visit. I am sure we shall all like you ever so much. Do you know you greatly remind me of the minister who was here when my husband and I first went to housekeeping. He died a driveling idiot.”</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>In a remote village there was located a clergyman who divided his energies between two small parishes. Diplomacy was not his strong point. Probably not one-third of his <a id="Page_204" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="204"></a> hearers were communicant members. And under his austere ministrations, many who were fairly regular in their attendance showed a marked reluctance to allow themselves to be enrolled officially.</p>
<p>In consequence of this unwillingness to assume church responsibilities, the pastor held very pessimistic views as to their probable future and did not hesitate to make it fairly clear and definite when occasion permitted.</p>
<p>A great opportunity came to him and it may be truthfully said that he made the most of it.</p>
<h3 id="The_Love_Cracked_Suicide">The Love-Cracked Suicide</h3>
<p>Away back in the hills there was a young man of nineteen or twenty who had become greatly interested in a somewhat frivolous maiden of sixteen years. Psychologists of the present would have probably pronounced Jim’s development as about equal to that of ten or twelve years. He was distinctly defective mentally, but a good worker on the farm and of generally amiable tendencies. Theology to him was as remote a topic as Babylonian literature. <a id="Page_205" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="205"></a></p>
<p>But Jim had very definite views as to this girl. He was infatuated to the point of desperation.</p>
<p>The young lady in question considered it a great joke. One evening she would be very bland and agreeable and the next time Jim appeared, she would be very much the reverse. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the details which are too familiar to most people to require explanation. She was having a beautiful time tormenting poor Jim. One evening she carried it a little too far and Jim left her convinced that life was not worth living. Retiring to a lonely hilltop with a heavily loaded shotgun, he departed this life with almost incredible rapidity.</p>
<p>This unfortunate event created a wide sensation. Overwhelmed with remorse, the young lady could not sufficiently abase herself. Therefore, when the funeral was held in the little country church, she appeared first among the mourners, although there is not the slightest probability that she would ever have married poor Jim had he lived to continue his courtship. <a id="Page_206" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="206"></a></p>
<p>Knowing Jim’s amiable qualities, all of the community were sympathetic except the pastor. To him this situation presented the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
<p>The keynote of the funeral discourse was soon made apparent by the text:</p>
<p>“And Paul cried with a loud voice: Do thyself no harm.”</p>
<p>Whereupon the astonished congregation found that instead of having gathered to hear words of sympathy for the family bereaved by the insane act of a love-crazed youth, they were to hear words of condemnation and vituperation with direful warnings of eternal misery.</p>
<p>The more intelligent people listened with disgust, while those who seldom, if ever, entered the church, looked on with amusement. With the completion of the services, the people gladly withdrew from the ministerial presence and when safely outside, their general views were summarized by the comments of the local cobbler.</p>
<p>“Well, the parson certainly had it in for poor Jim; he held him out over Tophet for about an hour and then kicked him over in!” <a id="Page_207" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="207"></a></p>
<h3 id="There_is_a_Lion_in_the_Way">“There is a Lion in the Way”</h3>
<p>On a certain July Sabbath the afternoon service in the little church seemed to drag. There had been a long morning service, and a session of the Sunday school earlier in the day, so it perhaps may not seem surprising that some of the congregation were seen to nod at times and then with renewed effort, concentrate their attention upon the minister.</p>
<p>The pastor of the parish was greatly beloved for his personal characteristics, but not greatly admired as a preacher. His oratorical process consisted of slow, rambling talks in a low monotone intermingled with occasional emphatic remarks in a very loud voice.</p>
<p>The breeze which had been coming through the open windows died away and the congregation became more and more drowsy. The pastor, amiable and considerate, was the last preacher in the world to resent somnolence on the part of his audience.</p>
<p>The sermon progressed and the pastor’s thought was being slowly and laboriously laid before the few who were still awake. When <a id="Page_208" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="208"></a> he found it consistent with his system of discourse, he often projected an allegorical picture upon the mental processes of his hearers.</p>
<p>Suddenly raising his voice until it echoed and re-echoed throughout the edifice, he shouted:</p>
<p>“But there is a lion in the way!”</p>
<p>A rustle passed over the congregation and all the drowsy ones sat up, some few looking around hurriedly in various directions but becoming speedily reassured.</p>
<p>The fact that a combined circus and menagerie was advertised to exhibit in a nearby town within a few days might possibly have had something to do with the unexpected success of the pastor’s allegory.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>The enrollment in a certain community church was relatively small because of a diversity of the religious beliefs among the various families. Those who did not belong to the faith represented by the minister were indisposed at that period to accept membership in the church, even if they might be fairly regular in their attendance and assist <a id="Page_209" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="209"></a> in the church financially. Others, of course, were indifferent altogether.</p>
<h3 id="The_Man_Who_Borrowed_Arabian_Nights_from_a_Christian_Woman">The Man Who Borrowed “Arabian Nights” from a Christian Woman</h3>
<p>A man, naturally bright, but of limited education, had an unusually good excuse for not attending church. He had a very large family which taxed all his energies to support, and was sadly lacking in church-going apparel. One day, while at the house of a neighbor, he asked the woman of the household, who was a conscientious church worker, to loan him a book to read.</p>
<p>Thinking that this man might enjoy tales of the marvelous, the woman loaned him a copy of an expurgated edition of “Arabian Nights.” He took the book away with him and kept it for some time.</p>
<p>Finally one evening he brought it back. When asked if he had read the book through, he said he had read part of it, but it had troubled him. Asked for a more definite explanation, he expressed himself as follows: <a id="Page_210" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="210"></a></p>
<p>“Well,” said he, “to tell the plain truth, I was shocked when I started reading. I could not understand how any Christian woman could loan me such, a pack of lies as there is in that book!”</p>
<p>All of which well illustrates the different standards of the Victorian period as compared with those of the present day.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>The congregation of a certain New England church, especially the feminine portion, were full of appreciation, admiration and sympathy for one of the deacons.</p>
<h3 id="The_Woman_Who_Was_Not_Going_to_be_a_Pack_Horse">The Woman Who Was Not Going to be a Pack Horse</h3>
<p>This man wore a constant expression of submission and meekness. He was an exemplary citizen in every respect and was faithful in his attendance to the duties of his office.</p>
<p>There was a special reason why the women of the church so highly approved of the deacon. It was reported that his wife was very impatient with him. <a id="Page_211" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="211"></a></p>
<p>Gradually there developed an atmosphere of coldness toward the wife, more than counter-balanced by the sympathetic friendliness toward her husband. This was somewhat irritating to the lady in question, who so far as she knew had never transgressed any of the general laws of society nor of the church. After a while the deacon’s wife became very unreconciled at the situation and from dwelling upon the matter she became probably more irritable than a deacon’s wife should be.</p>
<p>One day some unfortunate event led this woman to express herself more freely to her husband than she had done for a long time. As usual he accepted her remarks with docility and calmness.</p>
<p>The deacon went to his room and the wife went about her tasks in a tumult of dissatisfaction with herself and the entire situation. She recalled legends of the deacon’s early life which indicated he was of a very high temper. If he had only said something in self-defense, the situation would be more bearable. Shortly afterward she had occasion to go up stairs and as her felt slippers made little <a id="Page_212" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="212"></a> noise, she approached the conjugal chamber unnoted. Hearing the sound of her husband’s voice, she stopped at the nearly closed door to listen.</p>
<p>The deacon was engaged in prayer and she listened to hear him express his thanks that although a wilful, perverse person, he had been permitted to have a cross to bear, or rather a thorn in the flesh in the form of his wife, in consequence of which he could develop patience, endurance and the various divine virtues.</p>
<p>The deacon’s wife listened to the foregoing in amazement and then it all dawned upon her. Pushing open the door and quickly confronting her astonished husband, she said:</p>
<p>“I understand it all now. Perhaps you think I am going to be a pack horse to carry you to Heaven, but you will find out differently.”</p>
<p>The legend says that the subsequent amiability and angelic sweetness of the wife eventually caused the deacon to appear almost irascible at times. <a id="Page_213" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="213"></a></p>
<p>Among the regular attendants at a little country church, were a rather attractive, enterprising young lady and a very bashful young man.</p>
<h3 id="The_Enterprising_Deacon_Who_Proposed_at_the_Grave">The Enterprising Deacon Who Proposed at the Grave</h3>
<p>As may often be observed, under such circumstances, the vivacious young lady possessed great attractiveness in the eyes of the young man, but held back by his natural diffidence, he failed to make his admiration definitely known to the girl. She was not lacking in other admirers and so it happened that when the young man in question finally developed sufficient courage to ask the young lady to marry him, he was informed in the most gracious manner that while she had always esteemed him highly as a friend and might have even had a greater interest in him, a more self-confident rival had secured her promise to marry him.</p>
<p>The young man was naturally very much cast down. The apparent admission on the young lady’s part that his answer might have <a id="Page_214" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="214"></a> been different had he been a little more prompt in making his wishes known, was especially depressing to him.</p>
<p>A few years passed and the young woman, who had apparently lived happily with her husband, was unfortunately left a widow. Her former admirer decided that he would not be backward this time, but just as soon as any decent period had passed, he would resume paying his addresses and thereby forestall any of the other eligibles of the community. He called upon the young woman and was graciously received and thus encouraged proceeded to carry on his courtship with a vigor and enthusiasm that to his own highly developed sense of the fitness of things, seemed to border upon impropriety. Finally he brought matters to a climax by again offering his hand and fortune to the blooming widow. Greatly to his chagrin he was informed, as before, that she was promised to another man.</p>
<p>This was hard luck indeed and the disappointed wooer was almost inclined to resort to that quite common rural expedient and <a id="Page_215" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="215"></a> marry some other girl “out of spite.” But somehow this did not seem to square with his conscientious scruples and in fact there was no other girl about who seemed to attract him. It was a depressing situation indeed.</p>
<p>But, as sometimes happens, she who had been maid, wife, widow and again wife, once more became a widow. The twice disappointed devotee decided this time there would be no delays due to a fantastic sense of what was suitable and proper.</p>
<p>Accordingly the very next evening he called to see the doubly bereaved woman. She met him very cordially and his hopes arose high. Feeling that he had already made his regard for her sufficiently clear so that there need be no time lost in preliminaries, he gave but a few minutes’ consideration to discussing the weather and other common topics before proceeding to the matter at hand. He asked her to marry him.</p>
<p>The young woman gazed at him sympathetically a moment and then murmured:</p>
<p>“I am so sorry but I am already engaged; Deacon Harris proposed at the grave!” <a id="Page_216" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="216"></a></p>
