<body><h3 id="Putty_Bur_r_ds">“Purty Bur-r-ds”</h3>
<p>“Jim” lived on very harmonious terms with his better half, but he had one bad habit. When he had occasion to visit a nearby village for supplies, he was apt to linger rather late. Under these circumstances, his wife, with a proper understanding of the necessity of regularity in farm details, would milk the cows. It is not of course to be expected that she did this very willingly, but she would do it if the occasion seemed to require it.</p>
<p>Late one evening in autumn, an acquaintance of Jim’s, passing by his establishment, was surprised to see Jim driving his cows in from the pasture, same being presumptive evidence that they had not been milked. As he passed the gateway he met Jim face to face.</p>
<p>“It seems to me you are pretty late getting in your cows, Jim,” was the remark.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Jim, “it’s pretty late. I have just got back from town.”</p>
<p>“Do you have to milk ’em all yourself?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Jim, “me wife can milk if she’s a mind to.” <a id="Page_48" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="48"></a></p>
<p>“What’s the matter tonight?” was the natural query.</p>
<p>“Oh! she’s mad at me tonight,” said Jim, “she says she’s good and tired of doing the milkin’ and me loafin’ ’round the town.”</p>
<p>“Well, Jim,” said the traveler, who knew Mrs. Jim and admired her spunk, “when the women get their backs up we have to do about as they say.”</p>
<p>“It’s right ye are,” said Jim, “they know how to raise the divil himself when they feel that way. They are purty bur-r-ds but they have their outs!”</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>It will be noted by the reader that Jim accepted the inevitable which was certainly the proper attitude. Every normal husband appreciates the fact that the advantages of matrimony greatly outweigh any associated drawbacks. In fact there is an occasional husband who seems to appreciate it too much, which is abundantly illustrated in another legend of rural New England, long since forgotten by most of the local inhabitants. <a id="Page_49" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="49"></a></p>
<h3 id="Seven_Wives_and_Seven_Prisons">“Seven Wives and Seven Prisons”</h3>
<p>A young woman had continued to linger in the parental household until she had considerably passed the average age of marriage. Somehow the young men of her acquaintance had failed to appreciate her. Therefore it was all the more gratifying when a recent arrival in the community, a man of ingratiating appearance, began to pay her marked attentions. Her romantic impulses which had been subdued by untoward circumstances, could now be given full sway. Her admirer was impetuous and would hear of no delays, and they were soon married.</p>
<p>The historian does not furnish any details of the honeymoon nor how long it lasted, but it would appear that the bride, although of a clinging nature, was very curious as to her husband’s antecedents, and this, unfortunately, was the weak spot in his armour. The more the aforesaid antecedents were investigated, the more unattractive they proved to be and within a very short time the bride indignantly refused to have any further dealings <a id="Page_50" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="50"></a> with her husband, incidentally starting a line of inquiry with startling results; the man was apparently a bigamist.</p>
<p>With indefatigable zeal, the bride and her disgusted parents continued their investigations which soon resulted in the bridegroom being snugly established in the local jail.</p>
<p>Then followed a remarkable series of revelations. A wife was discovered at about every turn in the crooked path of the prisoner, who engaged a lawyer and resigned himself to the inevitable.</p>
<p>Some months were to elapse before a regular session of court and in the meantime the bridegroom found time hanging heavily on his hands. Apparently the game was up and, with the inordinate vanity of certain criminal minds, he decided to write an autobiography. In due course of time there appeared a remarkable book, entitled, “Seven Wives and Seven Prisons,” which created a sensation. It also aroused much local feminine indignation, because, in his desire to “get even” with his last wife, whom he regarded as responsible for his present misfortunes, the bigamist declared <a id="Page_51" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="51"></a> in his book that of all the wives he had ever had, she was not only the most disagreeable, but also the homeliest and the most generally unattractive.</p>
<p>Apparently masculine depravity could go no further.</p>
<h3 id="The_French_Canadian_Who_Wanted_a_War_for_the_Womens">The French-Canadian Who Wanted a “War for the Womens”</h3>
<p>Owing to the frailties of poor human nature, it often happens that even the most docile of husbands when disciplined, justifiably, of course, by their life partners, will seem to resent it. This is no doubt due to a yet remaining trace of that philosophy of the stone age which made the husband regard his wife as being subject to correction by himself. Of course with most enlightened husbands this quality, if it exists, is merely atavistic.</p>
<p>“Pete” was pretty well Americanized, but under stress of a little excitement was apt to have relapses of his early struggles with his verbs, singulars and plurals, etc. He was an estimable citizen in many ways and fully <a id="Page_52" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="52"></a> appreciated by his wife, a buxom lady who could, however, show a terrorizing sense of indignation on occasions when “Pete” had lingered too long with the bottle.</p>
<p>One of these interviews had just occurred and his wife’s disapproval had reached a new high record. A neighbor happened along just as the lecture was finished and “Pete” ambling somewhat uncertainly and disgustedly toward his barn was heard muttering to himself:</p>
<p>“Ought to be a war for the womens; too many womens; kill off some of the womens.”</p>
<p>But Pete was always glad to accept the olive branch and with his own natural good sense and the loyal regard and good judgment of his wife as factors, domestic felicity was always restored as soon as the sobering up process was ended.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that conjugal life, often looked upon with great skepticism by certain unmarried people, too cautious for their own good, as being monotonous in the extreme, is very frequently much the reverse; also that, generally speaking, husbands, especially of advanced <a id="Page_53" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="53"></a> age, will agree that they have deserved most of the wifely discipline they have experienced in their married lives, although they may, especially if in a certain part of New England, quote to prospective husbands, from the old time song:</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br/>
<span class="large smcap">Legends of the Eccentric</span></h2>
<p>The unusual mental twist which frequently escapes notice in the crowded city, is often the center of interest in a rural neighborhood. Those who thus excite morbid curiosity in their youth are indeed unfortunate and often suffer keenly from the semi-ostracism which sometimes follows. But the elderly who have developed unusual characteristics seem on the contrary to rather pride themselves upon their peculiarities, holding the view of the ancient Quaker who is reported to have said one day to his wife: “Everyone is queer but me and thee; and thee is some queer.”</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>Of the various minor misfortunes to which the elderly are subject, perhaps deafness is the most to be dreaded. This is illustrated in the case of the elderly country merchant.</p>
<h3 id="You_Don_t_Have_to_Yell_at_Me">“You Don’t Have to Yell at Me”</h3>
<p>Mr. H— was the prosperous owner of a general store and had about everything he <a id="Page_55" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="55"></a> needed except normal hearing. He was deaf, unmistakably deaf, but with the pathetic obstinacy of some thus afflicted, he would not admit it.</p>
<p>Late one afternoon a well-known citizen called at the store on an errand for his wife. Others were waiting as the following transaction was pulled off, and not strange to say, seemed to find it rather amusing.</p>
<p>“I want a half pound of cream tartar.”</p>
<p>The storekeeper seemed unusually impressed.</p>
<p>“Freem Parker,” said he. “What’s happened to him?”</p>
<p>Freeman Parker was a well known and popular citizen of the vicinity.</p>
<p>“A half pound of cream tartar, I said,” the customer replied, raising his voice.</p>
<p>“Freem Parker is dead,” said the merchant.</p>
<p>“Why, when did it happen?”</p>
<p>“I want a half pound of CREAM TARTAR,” was the reply in a very loud voice.</p>
<p>“Oh! you want cream tartar, do you,” said the dealer in icy tones.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to yell at me. I’m not deaf.” <a id="Page_56" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="56"></a></p>
<p>As before suggested, it is good policy in a rural district to cultivate reasonably cordial relations with one’s neighbors. Therefore it was probably poor tactics for a certain exasperated farmer to set a bear trap in his corn crib. To be sure, he was eminently successful, finding an exceedingly undesirable citizen the next morning securely fastened by one hand in the savage jaws of the trap. But it may be taken for granted that the farmer, who released the man at once, must have felt easier when the man left the neighborhood which it is hoped he soon did. Another farm owner was much more diplomatic.</p>
<h3 id="The_Story_of_the_Stolen_Bundle_of_Hay">The Story of the Stolen Bundle of Hay</h3>
<p>In this instance there was an exhibition of forbearance and strategy much to be admired.</p>
<p>Finding the barn door open one morning in the late winter, the farmer was at a loss to understand how the fastenings became loosened. Further inspection showed that hay had been thrown down from the loft. Still further examination revealed signs that hay had been <a id="Page_57" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="57"></a> carried away, presumably in a bundle on somebody’s shoulders.</p>
<p>A couple of mornings later there was further evidence of the same petty thieving. The farmer decided to watch and see what happened. As it was fairly comfortable sleeping on the hay rolled up in a blanket, the adventure assumed a considerable degree of entertainment.</p>
<p>About midnight the farmer was aroused by someone carefully opening the barn door. It was too dark to identify the intruder and in fact the farmer did not want to know who of his nearby acquaintances could stoop to anything so contemptible.</p>
<p>The thief had a long rope which in the dim light he laid upon the floor of the barn. He next piled on as much hay as he could well carry on his shoulders, and tying it up with the rope, he hastened away.</p>
<p>The farmer watched the man crossing the field. Suddenly an idea came to him; he did not want to have trouble with a neighbor and he did not want to lose any more hay. Following at a little distance behind the thief, <a id="Page_58" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="58"></a> his footsteps naturally unheard because of the rustle of the hay, the farmer struck a match and held it up to the bundle for an instant and then dodged behind a tree. A moment later the hay burst into flames. The thief dropped his rope and, screaming with terror, rushed from sight. It was evident that he regarded the fire as of supernatural origin. The farmer lost no more hay.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>Another farmer met a similar problem in a rather different manner. He was not overburdened with tender solicitude for ne’er-do-wells, as the following record will show.</p>
<h3 id="The_Raid_on_Jim_Green_s_Pork_Barrel">The Raid on Jim Green’s Pork Barrel</h3>
<p>Jim Green was the sort of agriculturalist who worked hard by day and slept hard by night. It therefore required several successive attempts one very early morning before his more wakeful wife succeeded in arousing him.</p>
<p>“Wake up! wake up!” said she, in a loud whisper, meanwhile nudging her sleeping husband vigorously. <a id="Page_59" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="59"></a></p>
<p>“Why—why, what’s the matter?” said Jim.</p>
<p>“There’s somebody in the cellar,” she whispered, “I’ve been hearing strange noises for several minutes.”</p>
<p>Jim was now wide awake and hastily slipping on a few clothes, he made his way to a window and in the dim light soon made out the figure of a man crouched down by the cellar window, evidently working with a partner. Further strain of the eyes revealed a pile of what Jim’s experienced vision showed him to be salt pork, lying on the ground at the man’s elbow. Jim tiptoed to a side door, opened it quietly and made his way as silently as possible to where the man was kneeling. But the slight rustle of his clothing or the jar of his footsteps alarmed the watcher at the window and, glancing over his shoulder, he hastily dodged around the corner of the wood shed.</p>
<p>Jim promptly took the missing man’s place by the cellar window and awaited developments. Shortly thereafter a man in the cellar came to the window by which Jim was crouching and passed out several pieces of <a id="Page_60" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="60"></a> very damp salt pork which Jim received silently.</p>
<p>“I’ve got all there is in the barrel,” he whispered, “except the last layer. Probably we better leave that so the folks here won’t be entirely out of pork.”</p>
<p>“No,” Jim whispered, “pull it all out; what do we care whether they have any pork or not?”</p>
<p>The man in the cellar went back and, plunging his arm deep in the clammy brine, succeeded in digging up the last layer of pork which he brought to the window, passing it up to the owner outside. He then climbed out of the cellar window himself, where he was promptly collared by Jim and identified as a shiftless farm laborer of the neighborhood. He was soon released, however, after he had revealed the name of his partner, another bird of similar feather.</p>
<p>Not until long after the two prowlers had removed from the neighborhood, did Jim tell the story. Neighbors then remembered that when Jim Green needed farm help, the two pork thieves always responded promptly. <a id="Page_61" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="61"></a></p>
<p>Comparatively few city born people realize how important a factor the weather is in the daily routine of the farmer. They know that a long-continued drought causes short crops and that floods sometimes do considerable damage in certain valleys. Of the inconvenience caused by unwelcome showers which sometimes become epidemic in busy seasons, they have no knowledge. In a certain thriving farming section, there had been a series of sudden thunder showers which had been very discouraging to hay makers.</p>
<h3 id="How_Lote_Platt_Beat_the_Thunder_Shower">How Lote Platt Beat the Thunder Shower</h3>
<p>“Lote” Platt had grown somewhat irascible in his old age and weather eccentricities had gradually become a personal matter with him. When unceremonious thunder showers had soaked a certain crop of clover hay about the third or fourth time, Lote began to feel peevish. However, he spread the hay out to dry and after one wet surface had responded to the sun’s rays, he turned the other side up and early in the afternoon <a id="Page_62" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="62"></a> found the clover in prime order to go in the barn.</p>
<p>He hastened to rake it into long windrows and was just preparing to send his hired man after the oxen and cart when he heard the grumbling of thunder and felt the coolness of the rain breeze. Another shower was coming!</p>
<p>The hired man started on the run to get the oxen, but Lote soon realized that the shower, and apparently a very wet one too, was going to reach the hay field long before the oxen could be gotten there.</p>
<p>“Boo-boo,” said Lote, as an unusually loud peal of thunder made the air vibrate. “I’ll show you something you never thought of.”</p>
<p>Lote was at the extreme windward side of the field and the long rows of freshly raked hay stretched out before the strong breeze, the forerunner of the approaching storm. Dropping on one knee, Lote scratched a match, shielded it a moment with his old straw hat and then held the blaze to the end of the windrow. Fanned by the wind, the fire followed the long row of dry hay across <a id="Page_63" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="63"></a> the field. Then another blaze followed by others also, and when the shower arrived, the clover which had cost so much labor to be fitted for the hay mow, had ceased to be a problem.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>When the proverbially amiable citizen bursts forth in rage, it is astonishing to those who look on, and apt to be quite disconcerting to a perfectly innocent victim. It certainly was to the lumberjack who was “bawled out” by Uncle Jimmy Ryan.</p>
<h3 id="The_Tale_of_the_Old_Fashioned_Settle">The Tale of the Old-Fashioned “Settle”</h3>
<p>A logging enterprise was under way back along the edge of the mountain and Uncle Jimmy’s wife was induced by the boss to board some of the help. A newcomer had joined the gang and was informed at quitting time that arrangements had been made for him to join the others at Uncle Jimmy’s.</p>
<p>The new recruit made his way with a half dozen other husky workers to the little low roofed farm house and going into the combined kitchen, dining and living room, dropped <a id="Page_64" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="64"></a> his bag in a corner, tossing his overcoat on one end of what seemed to be a large chest along the wall back of the cooking range.</p>
<p>Uncle Jimmy, a short and roly-poly man of sixty-five or so, was moving blandly about, speaking to one and then another of the “guests,” when suddenly his eye fell on the overcoat, hanging over one end of the chest. Rushing forward, he caught the coat and turning to the astonished man who owned it, proceeded to express great indignation, although in his excitement he had lapsed into the Irish brogue of his early days so that what he said was unintelligible.</p>
<p>Finally the wife who had kept serene during her husband’s tirade, made the matter clear.</p>
<p>The “chest” was an old-fashioned “settle” with an adjustable back. It contained a mattress and at about five o’clock every day Uncle Jimmy’s mother of ninety or more went to bed in the settle, the wooden back of which was shut down, closing tightly. A circular opening in the end, near the old lady’s face, provided air circulation. <a id="Page_65" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="65"></a></p>
<p>The lumberman had unknowingly closed the opening. The offender apologized and harmony was restored.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>There is no place like the farm for those unfortunates whose ability to perform crude manual labor is their chief asset. The farmer who must exercise a never failing forbearance in the management of horses and cattle often extends his sympathetic supervision over the mentally defective ones who can be utilized in providing the necessary hand labor. Thus it came about that one of those grown up children had found a comfortable home at Mr. Hubbard’s.</p>
<h3 id="The_Lost_Harrow_Teeth">The Lost Harrow Teeth</h3>
<p>Thomas was socially inclined and the boys of the community were too kindly disposed to exclude him from their company.</p>
<p>The owner of a nearby farm had been “seeding down” a stumpy addition to his pasture, and early in the summer some boys, including Thomas, wandered in that direction one Sunday afternoon, discovering a small <a id="Page_66" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="66"></a> wooden harrow with iron “teeth,” which had been left on the field until a more convenient season. The shrinking of the wood in the summer sun had loosened these teeth and a few of them had dropped out. Thus it came about that the boys were afflicted with a wonderfully funny idea.</p>
<p>A few mornings later Mr. Perry, the owner of the harrow and incidentally of several farms in the neighborhood, had occasion to drive up to Mr. Hubbard’s place on business. It was but a short distance and he could easily have walked, but for the fact that he was very lame.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubbard was at home, and receiving his visitor very cordially, they entered into an earnest conversation. The child of misfortune, Thomas, came around the corner of an outbuilding and seeing the two men so busily occupied, stopped at once. He seemed to be much agitated.</p>
<p>The conversation continued, the two neighbors, however, subconsciously watching the boy. Suddenly he rushed forward. <a id="Page_67" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="67"></a></p>
<p>“You old lame cuss!” said he, addressing the astonished visitor.</p>
<p>“You old lame cuss! I don’t know anything about your harrow teeth.” He then dodged back out of sight.</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other in amazement.</p>
<p>“What do you suppose he means?” said Mr. Perry.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” was the reply, “but I intend to find out.”</p>
<p>“Here, you, Thomas!” he called, “come back here.”</p>
<p>The boy came reluctantly forward, and after some questioning revealed that the boys in their holiday spirit of mischief had concealed the loose harrow teeth in a hollow stump near where the harrow lay as a joke on the Perry boys—a trifling matter in itself but which had assumed great and terrifying importance to poor unfortunate Thomas.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>To speak of the childish wrath of the aged is misleading in its suggestiveness. More properly we should refer to the childish wrath <a id="Page_68" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="68"></a> of the old man; for it is an undeniable fact that elderly women exhibit much greater patience with the inevitable annoyances of life than old men do.</p>
<p>A popular cartoonist has frequently exhibited these sudden tactics of impotent wrath in a very amusing way. But his imagination never has suggested anything more violent in its explosiveness than Uncle Reuben’s rage at a balky “salt shake.”</p>
<h3 id="The_Story_of_the_Salt_Shake">The Story of the Salt Shake</h3>
<p>Uncle Reuben and his more amiable wife were visiting with relatives. His hostess was one of the New England type who never could do enough for her guests.</p>
<p>Uncle Reuben who was quite advanced in years and whose habitual irritability had proportionally increased, was feeling unusually peevish this morning. It was midsummer and exceedingly warm and humid.</p>
<p>The contents of the glass salt shake allotted to this peevish old gentleman had become, like everything else, affected by the prevailing humidity. The most vigorous shaking failed <a id="Page_69" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="69"></a> to produce any results. After repeated attempts, Uncle Reuben paused and quietly examined the salt shake which he held in his hand. His amiable wife, knowing his characteristics, looked anxious. His kindly hostess, also well acquainted with the aforesaid characteristics, looked deeply concerned.</p>
<p>Finally Uncle Reuben spoke in those tones of forced calmness which are usually associated with some great crisis.</p>
<p>“Pauline,” said he, “I wish to buy this salt shake.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t sell it,” replied his hostess, “you may have it, and welcome.”</p>
<p>“No, I want to buy it!” said Uncle Reuben in dramatic tones.</p>
<p>“I want to buy it. I want to take it out to the stone pile and grind it to powder.”</p>
<h3 id="Better_Give_Them_to_Some_Poor_Boy">“Better Give Them to Some Poor Boy”</h3>
<p>Just because a man has to be supported as a public charge by the town he lives in, is no reason why he should not have some definite ideas about correct dress. <a id="Page_70" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="70"></a></p>
<p>“Uncle Timmy” may have seen better days, but it was so far back in his history that no one remembered anything about it. He was supplied with board in a private family at the town’s expense, the poor master incidentally providing two other urgent necessities, <i>viz.</i>, wearing apparel and chewing tobacco, the latter being purchased in quantity and “doled out” to Uncle Timmy little at a time, as otherwise the expense of this luxury would have reached a very large item in the course of a year.</p>
<p>About once in so often Uncle Timmy would happen around to see the poor master to talk things over. He was very sociable indeed and would go into all the details as to the menu at his boarding place, which was very seldom satisfactory.</p>
<p>One day Uncle Timmy appeared, and after he had given a report of how he was enjoying his present boarding place, it occurred to the poor master that a certain pair of misfit shoes, which were of no special value to anyone, might be utilized by this long-time guest of the community. So he brought out <a id="Page_71" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="71"></a> the shoes and suggested that Uncle Timmy take them home with him.</p>
<p>The old man turned the shoes over and over and examined them carefully. When it was suggested that he try them on, as apparently they would fit him, he shook his head.</p>
<p>“No,” said he. “I guess I won’t take them. You better give them to some poor boy.”</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Uncle Timmy was naturally an aristocrat. <a id="Page_72" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="72"></a></p>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br/>
<span class="large smcap">Family Characteristics and Small Town Life</span></h2>
<p>Those sections of rural New England which have possessed natural advantages sufficient to restrain the young people from their common propensity to emigrate to the cities or to the western states, are rich in family legends which show that frequent persistence of family traits which is exceptionally pronounced in the six little states of the northeast.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>A well-known family had occupied a prominent position in a certain New England town for several generations. During all this period certain pronounced characteristics had afforded amusement to the people of the community, especially those of the father and daughter whose mental processes are illustrated by the following narratives.</p>
<h3 id="The_Young_Man_Who_Had_Speerit">The Young Man Who Had “Speerit”</h3>
<p>The father had reached quite an advanced age, and although very amiable, had become <a id="Page_73" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="73"></a> exceedingly economical. There were people who would have said he was stingy—a common enough accusation against the aged. Besides his commodious house in town, he had a small farm and every spring he looked about and engaged some young man to undertake the double rôle of handy man around the house and farm laborer. The boy who took that job could be always sure of steady occupation; he was expected to rise early and work late.</p>
<p>One spring the old gentleman succeeded in securing a perfect treasure. A boy of eighteen years or thereabouts was engaged from a distant farm and came to town prepared to enjoy, what was to him, metropolitan life. A naturally willing worker, he soon found that there was little opportunity for recreation, at least during the daylight hours. In time he gradually made acquaintances who soon confirmed his own opinion that he was being imposed upon. He was still in awe of his employer, however, but finally an occasion developed when he could restrain himself no longer. On a very hot evening, after a hard <a id="Page_74" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="74"></a> day on the farm, he was directed to go into the wood shed and saw up some very dry fire wood of various uneven lengths. This was too much, and with a fluency which absolutely astonished both himself and listener, he proceeded to tell his employer just what he thought of his stinginess. For several minutes the old man stood perfectly amazed, the boy meantime hastening to his room, where he put on his best clothes and went up town. He naturally expected to be discharged, but such was not the case. After thinking the matter over a few minutes, the old man began to chuckle to himself, after which he shuffled off up the street, telling one citizen after another of his recent extraordinary experience.</p>
<p>“I like that boy,” said he. “He has speerit.”</p>
<h3 id="The_Lady_Who_Secured_a_Wardrobe">The Lady Who Secured a Wardrobe</h3>
<p>This old gentleman had a wife who was in delicate health and a middle-aged daughter who was not delicate. She was a very capable housekeeper and as a rule not socially inclined. She stayed at home month after <a id="Page_75" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="75"></a> month, year after year and finally her married sister and sister-in-law, neither of whom were reluctant to point out the path of duty to their amiable parent, insisted that it was only right that “Sally” should have a vacation. They pictured out the need of change of scene, incidentally laying particular stress upon the even greater need of a replenished wardrobe. The old gentleman was very reluctant to yield to their persuasions, especially in the matter of the appropriation for clothes. It gave him a pang to pass over the money necessary for the outfit, but under such effective concurrent pressure, the outcome can easily be imagined. He finally resigned himself to the inevitable, wrote a handsome check and costumers were put to work.</p>
<p>While these numerous family discussions were going on, “Sally” had seemed to show but a languid interest. This was attributed by her sisters to the fact that she had stayed at home so long that she didn’t want to go anywhere else. In the light of subsequent events it would appear that their diagnosis was correct. <a id="Page_76" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="76"></a></p>
<p>After the first pangs of separation from the cash, the father began to take an extraordinary interest in the outfitting process. He passed his judgment on the different fabrics, the styles into which they were to be made up and seemed to be looking forward with anticipation to the time when “Sally” would start out on her vacation trip with a wardrobe equal to that of any woman who had left that town in a long time.</p>
<p>Finally the outfit of new dresses, coats, hats, and other essential articles was complete and the day was set when the vacation should begin.</p>
<p>According to the plans, Sally was to go to New York to meet a family friend, visiting other points of interest as her impulses might suggest. The day of departure arrived, and Sally’s father was alive to the situation. A maid had been secured for a certain limited engagement and she was called early and told to prepare breakfast. The old man knocked vigorously on Sally’s door to make sure that she didn’t oversleep. Breakfast was ready and Sally did not appear. Her father began <a id="Page_77" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="77"></a> to be anxious lest she miss the train. He sent the maid up to knock at the door, who returned saying that Sally had answered, “All right.” Still she did not appear and it began to be certain that if she went that day she would have to go on a later train. Her father was indignant at her unwarranted indolence. He went up stairs and pounded once more on Sally’s door, which she opened, clad in her usual kitchen apparel. The old man demanded an explanation which was promptly forthcoming.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have the slightest intention of going to New York any of the time, but I knew that the only way I could ever get you to furnish me with any decent clothes, was to pretend I was going. Now I have the clothes and I am glad to have them, and I am going to stay at home and you can pay up that maid and let her go about her business.”</p>
<p>It must be regretfully stated that no record has been preserved of what Sally’s feminine relatives had to say to her. <a id="Page_78" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="78"></a></p>
<p>In certain social circles astonishing heraldic pedigrees make their appearance, heretofore all unsuspected by the average list of acquaintances, but there can be no camouflage about family pedigrees in a strictly rural neighborhood. An eminent financier in a New England town had a relative who did not add any prestige to the family escutcheon. Having little inclination to work and a very moderate earning power even when he did work, a small annuity which he received was greatly appreciated by this scion of a lofty family. For a short time after his quarterly allowance arrived, “Lafe” lived in luxury.</p>
<h3 id="The_Story_of_Lafe_and_the_Livery_Stable_Man">The Story of “Lafe” and the Livery Stable Man</h3>
<p>A widely known hotel man of the community had as a side interest, a small but well equipped livery stable, which in the days before the automobile, was a handy source of income. On a certain sultry summer day who should ramble into the livery stable but Lafe. The owner happened to be at the office and Lafe negotiated with him for the use of <a id="Page_79" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="79"></a> a horse and buggy, for a couple of hours. Knowing his man, the proprietor suggested that he had better pay in advance, as he himself might not be there when Lafe returned. This was but an agreeable detail to the man who was just then in funds and he passed out the money without any hesitation whatever, after which he took his seat in the buggy which had been run out of the barn preparatory to harnessing the horse to it.</p>
<p>As stated before, it was sultry and Lafe was not only oppressed by the heat, but also by several drinks he had enjoyed shortly before. He fell asleep. Therefore, when the horse was led out, it was decided that he better be led back into the barn again for a time and await developments. Lafe slumbered on, finally arousing himself just about the time when the two hours were up that he had contracted for. The livery stable man was not a trickster, but he greatly enjoyed a joke. He informed Lafe that he had had his ride so far as he was concerned, having occupied the buggy and having been in a position to use the horse, if he so desired. Lafe saw <a id="Page_80" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="80"></a> the joke, and being a good loser he promptly went away with a broad grin on his face, resolving to “get even.” The livery stable man industriously spread the story which came to Lafe’s ears quite frequently.</p>
<p>Some months afterwards the stable owner happened to be about sixty miles away taking a train for home and behold there was Lafe, also taking the train. The memory of that unenjoyed but paid for ride was still lingering in Lafe’s mind, so he asked the practical joker if he would not advance the money to pay his railroad fare.</p>
<p>“Why should you pay any railroad fares, when your cousin is a big owner in the railroad?” was the reply. “You just tell the conductor who you are and he will pass you without any ticket.”</p>
<p>“Will you back me up, if I do tell him?” asked Lafe.</p>
<p>“Certainly,” was the answer. “That will be all right.”</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">A SHADY DRIVE “DOWN EAST”</p>
</div>
<p>Whereupon Lafe took his seat in the front end of the day coach, the livery stable man being seated with a friend in the back part <a id="Page_81" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="81"></a> of the same car. Enter the conductor. He approached Lafe, demanding a ticket. Then followed a brief but animated conversation as a result of which Lafe turned and made a signal to the man in the rear of the car, who promptly nodded his head. The conductor therefore proceeded about his duties, collecting fares from various passengers, until he approached the livery man, who, stating his destination, handed him a mileage book. The conductor took the book and promptly detached two fares instead of one. When the owner of the mileage book asked the reason, he was informed by the conductor that he had been told by the man down in front that he would get his fare at the other end of the car and that he had confirmed the arrangement.</p>
<p>It may be taken for granted that among the habitues of the hotel and livery stable, the foregoing transactions were fully appreciated. Lafe was temporarily a hero, and no one enjoyed the joke better than the livery man did.</p>
<p>While it was regarded absolutely essential in small town life to be able, in New England <a id="Page_82" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="82"></a> phrase, to “take a joke,” there was of course a reasonable limit. A joke ceases to be a joke when there is any evidence of ill nature or maliciousness back of it. Just where the dividing line comes in of course varies with the circumstances.</p>

<p>In a certain rural town there was a young man whose tendency to slow wit was counter-balanced by a very amiable disposition. It is not surprising therefore that there should have been those who were inclined to take advantage and subject him to ridicule. This was less annoying to the victim of these jokes than to some of his friends.</p>
<h3 id="The_Man_Who_Wanted_to_Fight_a_Year_Afterward">The Man Who Wanted to Fight a Year Afterward</h3>
<p>One election day, in early September, the amiable young man in question, after depositing his ballot and going down the stairs from the hall where the election was held, was intercepted by some local clown who, taking him entirely off his guard, kicked him down the last few steps of the stairway to the floor <a id="Page_83" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="83"></a> below, where he landed in a very undignified attitude. With unruffled amiability the victim of horse play scrambled to his feet, brushed the dust from his clothes, and joined heartily in the empty laughter of the onlookers.</p>
<p>His close friends had not happened to witness this episode, but heard of it before leaving the hall. On their way home they expressed themselves very indignantly and asked the amiable victim why he submitted to such abuse, assuring him that he could easily make short work of the other man and there was no reason why he should put up with any such treatment. This put the matter in an entirely new light to the man who had shown such remarkable good nature a short time before. He thought deeply and said nothing.</p>
<p>The year rolled around and another September found the same assemblage at the town hall for the election. Everyone had forgotten the stairway incident of the year before, with one exception, and that was the victim. To the absolute amazement of all present, he hunted up his astonished antagonist of the year before and it required the combined <a id="Page_84" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="84"></a> efforts of all the young man’s friends to keep him from committing serious assault on the joker. He was restrained with some difficulty and taken to one side of the hall where his friends proceeded to explain to him that his grievance was now outlawed.</p>

<p>The trademark has become no small factor in modern business. Its imitation by rival firms is not only frowned upon as a breach of ethics, but in most civilized or even semi-civilized countries, it is illegal.</p>
<h3 id="A_Rural_Trademark">A Rural “Trademark”</h3>
<p>There was one such violation, however, many years ago in a small town, none of whose inhabitants perhaps had ever before heard of such a thing as a “trademark” in its modern meaning.</p>
<p>One of the chief sources of income to farmers in that section was butter-making. At that time all butter was put down in wooden tubs, which were mostly hand made. An old growth spruce tree of good size and of a certain grain would be sawed into right <a id="Page_85" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="85"></a> lengths. These would be split with great care into staves. These in turn would be shaved down as smoothly as possible, enclosed in ash hoops and fitted out with a cover, the rim of which was likewise an ash hoop.</p>
<p>An old man who had become quite skillful in manufacturing these butter packages, finally acquired such pride in his work that upon finishing each tub he would take a soft lead pencil and write his initials in large flourishing characters. As he was practically illiterate, his monogram was all the more amusing to others.</p>
<p>These packages were not only supplied to certain farmers, but were furnished to a nearby country store to be carried in stock. There were other builders of hand-made butter tubs who were not so careful about the finish of their articles.</p>
<p>One evening this creator of artistic butter tubs meandered to the village store. A waggish individual who saw him there and enjoyed his self-satisfied and expansive manner in the store, had one of those bright ideas which so frequently afflict humanity. In the <a id="Page_86" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="86"></a> back room of the store there were some butter packages manufactured by a rival of the artist before mentioned. These tubs were a little more uncouth in their getup than usual. The maker of this brand of packages had the excellent taste not to identify himself with his completed product by any monogram. Selecting one of the roughest looking of these packages, the joker borrowed a pencil and soon produced a crude imitation of the well known initials. He then walked into the inner store, handed the butter tub to the rival manufacturer and asked him how he ever had the face to put out such coarse looking work as that. The artist indignantly denying any responsibility for the tub, or even knowledge thereof, his attention was immediately called to the trademark on the bottom.</p>
<p>This was the last straw and the creator of masterpieces in the butter-tub making art, nearly produced a riot. He accused the storekeeper of connivance and a gross fraud on the community and threatened dire proceedings in other directions. The disgusted proprietor of the store finally succeeded in explaining <a id="Page_87" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="87"></a> the matter. The perpetrator of the joke slipped out of the store by the back way and eventually the rumblings of wrath and outraged culture subsided.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p>It has been before stated that the satisfaction of living on fairly amicable terms with one’s neighbors in a farming region tends to develop not only much forbearance but diplomacy as well. This was illustrated in a certain case where the bone of contention was a line fence.</p>
<h3 id="An_Early_Example_of_Camouflage">An Early Example of Camouflage</h3>
<p>A certain man who lived on a small farm had a perfect mania for lawsuits. This was not so uncommon in earlier days, as it was rather in the line of policy of certain pettifogging lawyers to encourage litigation.</p>
<p>Between his farm and the adjoining one there was a division fence which seemed to be always falling to pieces. The man who lived on this adjoining farm suspected that the cattle were not altogether to blame for the frequent breaches in the fence. The cattle <a id="Page_88" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="88"></a> continued to come over onto his land and he finally decided to devote one whole day, if necessary, to watchful waiting. He therefore established himself in a clump of bushes where he had a pretty good view of quite a stretch of the fence, and not very long afterwards he saw the half grown son of the belligerent neighbor approach the division line and loosen some of the rails to such an extent that it would be an easy matter for the cattle to get across.</p>
<p>The man on guard was puzzled for a moment just what to do, but realized the importance of avoiding hostilities with his neighbor, if it were possible. Finally he had an inspiration.</p>
<p>The boy who had done the mischief was well known in the neighborhood as somewhat defective mentally. Hastily removing his old coat, which had a very dilapidated lining, the resourceful observer turned it inside out and again put it on, dragging his old felt hat down over his eyes. Next he rubbed a handful of black dirt over his face, after which with blood curdling yells, he started down the hills <a id="Page_89" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="89"></a> toward the boy. One glimpse was enough for the youngster who fled to the house panic stricken. A little later on the diplomatist, resuming his normal appearance, apparently happened along in a leisurely way, repaired the fence and went home.</p>
<p>By a perhaps not unexplainable coincidence, the cattle remained on their own side of the fence thereafter.</p>

<p>In another locality there were four brothers whose personal traits were so markedly individual as to make the family stand out somewhat prominently in the community. All these amiable peculiarities were of course thoroughly understood by the local inhabitants. First one of the brothers and then another would figure in some transaction in a way to bring out the same family characteristic.</p>
<p>The oldest one of the four brothers bore the biblical name of Noah, and was a carpenter. Another brother often assisted him at the same trade. Still another brother was a farmer, while the fourth had no settled occupation. <a id="Page_90" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="90"></a></p>
<p>These amusing details of the various activities of these brothers finally inspired a local humorist to sum up the doings of the four in the following luminous example of rural verse:</p>
