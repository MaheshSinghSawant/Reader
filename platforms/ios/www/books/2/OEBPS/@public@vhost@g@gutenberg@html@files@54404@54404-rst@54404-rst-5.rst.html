<p class="pfirst"><span>Mehalah returned sadly to the Ray.  The hope that
had centred in help from Wyvenhoe had been extinguished.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her mother was greatly disappointed at the ill-success
of the application, but flattered at her cousin's
recollection of her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If it had not been for that woman's coming in
when she did, we should have had the money,' said
Mrs. Sharland.  'What a pity she did not remain away a
little longer.  Charles is very well disposed, and would
help us if he could pluck up courage to defy his wife.
Suppose you try again, Mehalah, some other day, and
choose your time well.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not go there again, mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If we do get turned out of this place we might
settle at Wyvenhoe, and then choose our opportunity.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, the man is completely under his wife's
thumb.  There is no help to be found there.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then, Mehalah, the only chance that remains, is to
get the money from the Mersea parson.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He cannot help us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is no harm trying.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The day on which Mrs. De Witt had threatened to
come had passed, without her appearing.  True it had
blown great guns, and there had been storms of rain.
Mrs. Sharland hoped that the danger was over.  The
primitive inhabitants of the marshes had dwelt on piles,
she built on straws.  Some people do not realise a
danger till it is on them and they cannot avert it.
Mrs. Sharland was one of these.  She liked her grievance,
and loved to moan over it; if she had not a real one she
invented one, just as children celebrate funerals over
dolls.  She had been so accustomed to lament over toy
troubles that when a real trouble threatened she was
unable to measure its gravity.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She was a limp and characterless woman.  Mehalah
had inherited the rich red blood of her grandparents,
and Mrs. Sharland had assimilated only the water,
and this flowed feebly through her pale veins.  Her
nature was parasitic.  She could not live on her own
root, but must adhere to a character stronger than
herself.  She had hung on and smothered her husband, and
now she dragged at her daughter.  Mehalah must stand
upright or Mrs. Sharland would crush her to the ground.
There are women like articles of furniture that will
'wobble' unless a penny or a wedge of wood be put
under their feet.  Mrs. Sharland was always crying out
for some trifle to steady her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah did not share her mother's anticipations
that the danger had passed with the day, that Mrs De
Witt's purpose had given way to kinder thoughts; she
was quite sure that she would prove relentless and push
matters to extremities.  It was this certainty which
drove her to act once more on her mother's suggestion,
and go to the Mersea Rectory, to endeavour to borrow
the sum of money needed to relieve them from
immediate danger.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She found the parson in his garden without his coat,
which hung on the hedge, making a potatoe pie for the
winter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was on all fours packing the tubers in straw.
His boots and gaiters were clogged with clay.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Hallo!' he exclaimed as Mehalah came up.  'You
are the girl they call Glory?  Look here.  I want you
to see my kidneys.  Did you ever see the like, come
clean out of the ground without canker.  Would you
like a peck?  I'll give them you.  Boil beautiful.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I want to speak with you, sir.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Speak then by all means, and don't mind me.  I
must attend to my kidneys.  A fine day like this is not
to be wasted at this time of the year.  Go on.  There
is an ashtop for you.  I don't care for the potatoe as a
potatoe.  It don't boil all to flour as I like.  You can
have a few if you like.  Now go on.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Down went his head again, and was buried in a nest
of straw.  Mehalah waited.  She did not care to address
his back and legs, the only part of his person visible.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You can't be too careful with potatoes,' said the
parson, presently emerging, very red in the face, and
with a pat of clay on his nose.  'You must make them
comfortable for the winter.  Do to others as you would
they should do to you.  Keep them well from frost,
and they will boil beautiful all the winter through.  Go
on with your story.  I am listening,' and in went the
head again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah lost heart.  She could not begin thus.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Pah! how I sweat,' exclaimed the parson, again
emerging.  'The sun beats down on my back, and
the black waistcoat draws the heat.  And we are in
November.  This won't last.  Have you your potatoes
in, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We have only a few on the Ray.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You ought to have more.  Potatoes like a light
soil well drained.  You have gravel, and with some
good cow-dung or sheep-manure, which is better still,
with your fall, they ought to do primely.  I'll give you
seed.  It is all nonsense, as they do here, planting
small whole potatoes.  Take a good strong tuber, and
cut it up with an eye in each piece; then you get a
better plant than if you keep the little half-grown
potatoes for seed.  However, I'm wasting time.  I'll be
back in a moment.  I must fetch another basket load.
Go on with your story all the same: I can hear you.  I
shall only be in the shed behind the Rectory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Parson Tyll was a curate of one parish across the
Strood and of the two on the island.  The rector was
non-resident, on the plea of the insalubrity of the spot.
He had held the rectory of one parish and the vicarage
of the other thirty years, and during that period had
visited his cures twice, once to read himself in, and on
the other occasion to exact some tithes denied him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'All right,' said Mr. Tyll, returning from the back
premises, staggering under a crate full of roots.  'Go
on, I am listening.  Pick up those kidneys which have
rolled out.  Curse it, I hate their falling and getting
bruised; they won't keep.  There now, you never saw
finer potatoes in your life than these.  My soil here is
the same as yours on the Ray.  Don't plant too close,
and not in ridges.  I'll tell you what I do.  I put mine
in five feet apart and make heaps round each.  I don't
hold by ridges.  Hillocks is my doctrine.  Go on, I am
listening.  Here, lend me a hand, and chuck me in the
potatoes as I want them.  You can talk all the same.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Parson Tyll crept into his heap and seated himself
on his haunches.  'Chuck away, but not too roughly.
They mustn't be bruised.  Now go on, I can stack the
tubers and listen all the same.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sir,' said Mehalah, out of heart at her reception,
'we are in great trouble and difficulty.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have no doubt of it; none in the world.  You
don't grow enough potatoes.  Now look at my kidneys.
They are the most prolific potatoes I know.  I
introduced them, and they go by my name.  You may ask
for them anywhere as Tyll's kidneys.  Go on, I am
listening.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We owe Mrs. De Witt a matter of five and twenty
pounds,' began Mehalah, red with shame; 'and how to
pay her we do not know.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Nor I,' said the parson.  'You have tried to go
on without potatoes, and you can't do it.  Others have
tried and failed.  You should keep geese on the saltings,
and fowls.  Fowls ought to thrive on a sandy soil, but
then you have no corn land, that makes a difference.
Potatoes, however, especially my kidneys, ought to be
a treasure to you.  Take my advice, be good, grow
potatoes.  Go on, I am listening.  Chuck me some
more.  How is the stock in the basket?  Does it want
replenishing?  Look here, my lass, go to the coach-house
and bring me some more.  There is a heap in the
corner; on the left; those on the right are ashtops.
They go in a separate pie.  You can talk as you go, I
shall be here and harkening.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah went sullenly to the place where the precious
roots were stored, and brought him a basketful.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'By the way,' said the parson, peeping out of his
mole-hill at her, 'it strikes me you ought not to be
here now.  Is there not a sale on your farm to-day?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A sale, sir?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A sale, to be sure.  Mrs. De Witt has carried off
my clerk to act as auctioneer, or he would be helping
me now with my potatoes.  She has been round to
several of the farmers to invite them to attend and bid,
and they have gone to see if they can pick up some
ewes or a cow cheap.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah staggered.  Was this possible?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go on with your story, I'm listening,' continued
the parson, diving back into his burrow, so that only
the less honourable extremity of his vertebral column
was visible.  'Talk of potatoes.  There's not one to
come up to Tyll's kidneys.  Go on, I am all attention!
Chuck me some more potatoes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But Mehalah was gone, and was making the best of
her way back.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Parson Tyll was right.  This fine November day
was that which it had struck Mrs. De Witt was most
suitable for the sale, that would produce the money.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah had not long left the Strood before a strange
procession began to cross the Marshes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt sat aloft in a tax-cart borrowed of
Isaac Mead, the publican, by the side of his boy who
drove.  Behind, very uncomfortably, much in the
attitude of a pair of scissors, sat the clerk, folded
nearly double in the bottom of the cart; his head
reclined on Mrs. De Witt's back and the seat of the
vehicle, his legs hung over the board at the back, and
swung about like those of a calf being carried to
market or to the butcher's.  Mrs. De Witt wore her
red coat, and a clean washed or stiffly starched cap.
She led the way.  The road over the Marshes was bad,
full of holes, and greasy.  A recent tide had corrupted
the clay into strong brown glue.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The farmers and others who followed to attend the
sale had put up their gigs and carts at the cottage of
the Strood keeper, and pursued their way on foot.  But
Mrs. De Witt was above such feebleness of nerve.  She
had engaged the trap for the day, and would take her
money's worth out of it.  The boy had protested at the
Strood that the cart of his master could not go over
the marshes, that Isaac Mead had not supposed it
possible that it would be taken over so horrible and
perilous a road.  Mrs. De Witt thereupon brought her
large blue gingham umbrella down on the lad's back,
and vowed she would open him like an oyster with her
pocket-knife unless he obeyed her.  She looked quite
capable of fulfilling her threat, and he submitted.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The cart jerked from side to side.  The clerk's head
struck Mrs. De Witt several sharp blows in the small
of her back.  She turned sharply round, pegged at him
with the umbrella, and bade him mind his manners.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me get out.  I can't bear this, ma'am,' pleaded
the man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It becomes you to ride to the door as the officer of
justice,' answered she.  'If I can ride, so can you.
Lie quiet,' and she banged at him with the umbrella
again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At that moment there came a jolt of a more violent
description than before, and Mrs. De Witt was suddenly
precipitated over the splash-board, and, after a battle
in the air, on the back of the prostrate horse, with her
feet, hands and umbrella she went into a mud hole.
The horse was down, but the knees of the clerk were
up far above his head.  He struggled to rise, but was
unable, and could only bellow for assistance.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt picked herself up and assisted the
boy in bringing the horse to his feet again.  Then she
coolly pinned up her gown to her knees, and strode
forward.  The costume was not so shocking to her
native modesty as might have been supposed, nor did
it scandalise the farmers, for it was that adopted by the
collectors of winkles on the flats.  The appearance
presented by Mrs. De Witt was, however, grotesque.  In
the mud her legs had sunk to the knees, and they
looked as though she wore a pair of highly polished
Hessian boots.  The skirt and the red coat gave her a
curious nondescript military cut, as half Highlander.
Though she walked, she would not allow the clerk to
dismount.  She whacked at the pendant legs when they
rose and protested, and bade the fellow lie still; he was
all right, and it was only proper that he, the functionary
on the occasion, should arrive in state, instead of on his
own shanks.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you get up on the seat you'll be bobbed off like
a pea on a drum.  Lie in the bottom of the cart and
be peaceful, as is your profession,' said Mrs. De Witt,
with a dig of the umbrella over the side.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They formed a curious assemblage.  There were the
four brothers Marriage of Peldon, not one of whom had
taken a wife.  Once, indeed, the youngest, Herbert, had
formed matrimonial schemes; but on his ventilating
the subject, had been fallen on by his three brothers and
three unmarried sisters who kept house for them, as
though he had hinted the introduction of a cask of
gunpowder into the cellars.  He had been scolded and
lectured, and taunted, as the apostate, the profligate,
the prodigal, who was bent on the ruin of the family,
the dissipation of the accumulated capital of years of
labour, the introducer of discord into a united household.
And yet the household was only united in theory, in fact
the brothers were always fighting and swearing at one
another about the order of the work to be executed on
the farm, and the sisters quarrelled over the household
routine.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was Joshua Pudney, of Smith's Hall, who
loved his bottle and neglected his farm, who grew more
thistles than wheat, and kept more hunters than cows,
a jolly fat red-faced man with white hair, always in top
boots.  Along with him was Nathaniel Pooley, who
combined preaching with farming, was noted for sharp
practice in money matters, and for not always coming
out of pecuniary transactions with clean hands.  Pudney
cursed and Pooley blessed, yet the labourers were wont
to say that Pudney's curses broke no bones, but Pooley's
blessings did them out of many a shilling.  Pudney let
wheat litter in his stubble, and bid the gleaners go in
and be damned, when he threw the gate open to them.
Pooley raked the harvest field over thrice, and then
opened the gleaning with an invocation to Providence
to bless the widow, the fatherless, and the poor who
gathered in his fields.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Farmer Wise was a gaunt, close-shaven man, always
very neatly dressed, a great snuff-taker.  He was a
politician, and affected to be a Whig, whilst all the rest
of his class were Tories.  He was argumentative,
combative, and cantankerous, a close, careful man, and
reported a miser.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A dealer, riding a black pony, a wonderful little
creature that scampered along at a flying trot, came up
and slackened rein.  He was a stout man in a very
battered hat, with shabby coat; a merry man, and a
good judge of cattle.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The proceedings of the day were, perhaps, hardly in
accordance with strict English law, but then English law
was precisely like Gospel precepts, made for other folk.
On the Essex marshes people did not trouble themselves
much about the legality of their proceedings; they took
the law into their own hands.  If the law suited them
they used it, if not they did without it.  But, legally or
not legally, they got what they wanted.  It was
altogether inconvenient and expensive for the recovery of a
small debt to apply to a solicitor and a magistrate, and
the usual custom was, therefore, to do the thing cheaply
and easily through the clerk of the parish constituted
auctioneer for the occasion, and the goods of the
defaulter were sold by him to an extemporised assembly
of purchasers on any day that suited the general
convenience.  The clerk so far submitted to legal
restrictions that he did not run goods </span><em class="italics">up</em><span>, but down; he
began with an absurdly high figure, instead of one
preposterously low.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When the cart and its contents and followers arrived
at the Ray, the horse was taken out, and the vehicle
was run against a rick of hay, into which the shafts
were deeply thrust, so as to keep the cart upright, that
it might serve as a rostrum for the auctioneer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We'll go and take stock first,' said the clerk;
'we've to raise twenty-five pounds for the debt and
twenty shillings my costs.  What is there to sell?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Wait a bit, gaffer,' said the cattle jobber; 'you're
a trifle too quick.  The old lady must demand the
money first.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'm agoing to do so, Mr. Mellonie,' said Mrs. De
Witt; 'you teach your grandmother to shell shrimps.'  Then,
looking round on about twenty persons who had
assembled, she said, 'Follow me.  Stay! here comes
more.  Oh! it is Elijah Rebow and his men come to see
fair play.  Come by water have you, Elijah?  We are
not going to sell anything of yours, you needn't fear.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She shouldered her umbrella like an oar, and strode
to the house door.  Mrs. Sharland was there, white and
trembling.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you got my money?' asked Mrs. De Witt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, mistress,' exclaimed the unfortunate widow,
'do have pity and patience.  Mehalah has just gone to
get it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Gone to get it?' echoed Mrs. De Witt.  'Why,
where in the name of wonder does she expect to get it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She had gone to Parson Tyll to borrow it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then she won't get it,' said the drover.  'There's
no money to be wrung out of empty breeches pockets.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me into the house,' said Mrs. De Witt.  'Let
us all see what you have got.  There's a clock.  Drag
it out, and stick it up under the tree near the cart.
That is worth a few pounds.  And take that chair.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is my chair.  I sit in it, and I have the ague
so bad.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Take the chair,' persisted Mrs. De Witt, and
Rebow's men carried it forth.  'There's some good
plates there.  Is there a complete set?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There are only six.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is better than none.  Out with them.
What have you got in the corner cupboard?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Nothing but trifles.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We'll sell the cupboard and the dresser.  You can't
move the dresser, Elijah.  We'll carry it in our heads.
Look at it,' she said to the clerk; 'see you don't forget
to put that up.  Now shall we go into the bedrooms, or
go next to the cowhouse?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Leave the bedroom,' said Mellonie, 'you can't sell
the bed from under the old woman.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can though, if I don't raise enough,' said
Mrs. De Witt.  'I've slept on a plank many a time.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh dear!  Oh dear!' moaned the widow Sharland;
'I wish Mehalah had returned; perhaps she has the
money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No chance of that, mistress,' said Rebow.  'You
are sold up and done for past escape now.  What will
you do next, you and that girl Glory, I'd like to
know?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I think she will get the money,' persisted the
widow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah turned from her with a sneer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Outside with you,' shouted Mrs. De Witt.  'The
sale is going to begin.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The men—there were no women present except
Mrs. De Witt—quickly evacuated the house and pushed
into the stable and cowhouse.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was no horse, and only one cow.  The sheep
were on the saltings.  There was no cart, and very few
tools of any sort.  The little farm was solely a sheep
farm, there was not an acre of tillage land attached to it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The clerk climbed up into the cart.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Stop, stop, for Heaven's sake!' gasped Mehalah
dashing up.  'What is this!  Why have we not been
warned?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh yes! forewarned indeed, and get rid of the
things,' growled Mrs. De Witt.  'But I did tell you
what I should do, and precious good-natured I was to
do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah darted past her into the house.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Tell me, tell me!' cried the excited mother, 'have
you the money?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No.  The parson could not let me have it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Hark! they have begun the sale.  What is it they
are crying now?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The clock, mother.  Oh, this is dreadful.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They will sell the cow too,' said the widow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Certain to do so.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There!  I hear the dresser's put up.  Who has
bought the clock?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh never mind, that matters nothing.  We are
ruined.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh dear, dear!' moaned Mrs. Sharland, 'that it
should come to this!  But I suppose I must, I must
indeed.  Run, Mehalah, run quick and unrip the belt
of my green gown.  Quick, fetch it me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl hastily obeyed.  The old woman got her
knife, and with trembling hand cut away the lining in
several parts of the body.  Shining sovereigns came
out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There are twenty here,' she said with a sigh, 'and
we have seven over of what George let us have.  Give
the wretches the money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, mother!' exclaimed Mehalah.  'How
could you borrow!  How could you send me——!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never mind, I did not want to use my little store
till every chance had failed.  Run out and pay the
money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah darted from the door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The clerk was selling the cow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Going for twenty-five pounds.  What? no one
bid, going for twenty-five pounds, and dirt cheap at the
money, all silent!  Well I never, and such a cow!
Going for twenty-three——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Stop!' shouted Mehalah.  'Here is Mrs. De
Witt's money, twenty-five pounds.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Damnation!' roared Elijah, 'where did you get it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Our savings,' answered Mehalah, and turned her
back on him.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Mehalah was hurt and angry at her mother's conduct.
She thought that she had not been fairly treated.
When the loss sustained presumably by Abraham Dowsing's
carelessness had been discovered, Mrs. Sharland
had not hinted the existence of a private store, and had
allowed De Witt to lend her the money she wanted for
meeting the rent.  Glory regarded this conduct as
hardly honest.  It jarred, at all events, with her sense
of what was honourable.  On the plea of absolute
inability to pay the rent, they had obtained five and
twenty pounds from the young fisherman.  Then again,
when Mrs. De Witt reclaimed the debt, Mehalah had
been subjected to the humiliation of appealing to
Mr. Pettican and being repulsed by Admonition.  She had
been further driven to sue a loan of the parson; she
had not, indeed, asked him for the money, but that was
only because he avoided, intentionally or not she could
not say, giving her the chance.  She had gone with the
intention of begging, and his manner, and the accidental
discovery that the sale was already taking place, had
alone prevented her from undergoing the shame of
asking and being refused.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not like to charge her mother with having
behaved dishonourably, for she felt instinctively that her
mother's views and hers were not coincident.  Her brow
was clouded, and an unpleasant gleam flickered in her
eyes.  She resisted the treatment she had been subjected
to as unnecessary.  It was only justifiable in an extreme
emergency, and no such emergency had existed.  Her
mother would rather sacrifice her daughter's self-respect
than break in on the little hoard.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Charles said he had money in the bank, did he?'
asked Mrs. Sharland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To think of that!  My cousin has an account in
the bank, and can write his cheques, and one can cash
cheques signed Charles Pettican!  That is something to
be proud of, Mehalah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Indeed, mother?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And you say he has a beautiful house, with a
verandah.  A real gilt balcony.  Think of that!  And
Charles is my cousin, the cousin of your own mother.
There's something to think of, there.  I couldn't sleep
last night with dreaming of that house with its green
shutters and a real balcony.  I do believe that I shall
die happy, if some day I may but see that there
gilded—you said it was gilded—balcony.  Charles Pettican
with a balcony!  What is the world coming to next!
A real gilded balcony, and two figureheads looking
over—there's an idea!  Did you tell me there was a sofa in
his sitting-room; and I think you said the dressing-table
had a pink petticoat with gauze over it.  Just think
of that.  I might have been Mrs. Charles Pettican, if
all had gone well, and things had been as they should
have, and then I should have had a petticoat to my
dressing-table and a balcony afore my window.  I am
glad you went, it was like the Queen of Sheba visiting
Solomon and seeing all his glory, and now you've come
back into your own land, and filled me with your tidings.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah let her mother meander on, without paying
any attention to what she said.  Mrs. Sharland had
risen some stages in her self-importance since she had
heard how prosperous in a pecuniary sense her relation
was.  It shed a sort of glory on her when she thought
that, had fate ruled it so, she might have shared with
him this splendour, instead of being poor and lonely on
the desolate Ray.  Mrs. Sharland would have loved a
gossip, but never got a chance of talking to anyone with
a similar partiality.  Had she married Mr. Charles
Pettican she would have been in the vortex of a maelstrom
of tittle-tattle.  It was something to puff her up to
think that if matters had taken another turn this would
have been her position in Wyvenhoe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't think Mrs. De Witt had any notion how rich
and distinguished my relatives are, when she came here
asking for her five and twenty pounds.  I'll take my
oath on it, she has no cousin with a balcony and a sofa.
I don't suppose we shall be troubled much now, when it
is known that my cousin draws cheques, and that the
name of Charles Pettican is honoured at the bank.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You forget we got, and shall get, no help from him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not forget it, Mehalah.  I remember perfectly
how affably he spoke of me—his Liddy Vince, his pretty
cousin.  I do not forget how ready he was to lend the
money.  Twenty pounds! if you had asked fifty, he'd
have given it you as readily.  He was about to break
open his cash-box, as he hadn't the key by him, and
would have given me the money I wanted, had not a
person who is no relation of mine interposed.  That
comes of designing women stepping in between near
relatives.  Charles Pettican is my cousin, and he is not
ashamed to acknowledge it; why should he?  I have
always maintained myself respectable, and always shall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother,' said Mehalah, interrupting this watery
wash of vain twaddle, 'you should not have borrowed
the money of George De Witt.  That was the beginning
of the mischief?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Beginning of what mischief?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The beginning of our trouble.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, it was not; Abraham's carelessness was the
beginning.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But, mother, I repeat it, you did wrong in not
producing your hidden store instead of borrowing.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I did not borrow.  I never asked George De Witt
for his money, he proposed to let us have it himself.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is indeed true; but you should have at once
refused to take it, and said it was unnecessary for us to
be indebted to him, as you had the sum sufficient laid by.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is all very well, Mehalah, but when a generous
offer is made me, why should I not accept it?  Because
there's still some milk of yesterday in the pan, do
you decline to milk the cow to-day?  I was glad of the
opportunity of keeping my little savings untouched.
Besides, I always thought George would make you his wife.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I thought so too,' said Mehalah in a low tone, and
her face became sad and blank as before; she went off
into a dream, but presently recovered herself and said,
'Then, when Mrs. De Witt asked for her money, why
did you not produce it, and free us of her insults and
annoyance?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I did not want to part with my money.  And it
has turned out well.  If I had done as you say, we
should not have revived old acquaintance, and obtained
the valuable assistance of Charles Pettican.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He did not assist us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He did as far as he was able.  He would have
given us the money, had not untoward circumstances
intervened.  He as good as let us have the twenty
pounds.  That is something to be proud of—to be
helped by a man whose name is honoured at the
bank—at the Colchester Bank.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But, mother, you have given me inexpressible
pain!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Pained you!' exclaimed Mrs. Sharland.  'How
could I?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her eyes opened wide.  Mehalah looked at her.
They had such different souls, that the girl saw it was
of no use attempting to explain to her mother what
had wounded her; her sensations belonged to a sense of
which her mother was deprived.  It is idle to speak of
scarlet to a man who is blind.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I did it all for you,' said Mrs. Sharland
reproachfully.  'I was thinking and caring only for you,
Mehalah, from beginning to end, from first to last.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Thinking and caring for me!' echoed Glory in
surprise.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Of course I was.  I put those gold pieces away,
one a quarter from the day you were born, till I had
no more savings that I could put aside.  I put them
away for you.  I thought that when I was gone and
buried, you should have this little sum to begin the
world upon, and you would not say that your mother
died and left you nothing.  Nothing in the world would
have made me touch the hoard, for it was your money,
Mehalah—nothing but the direst need, and you will do
me the justice to say that this was the case to-day.  It
would have been the worst that could have happened
for you to-day had the money not been paid, for you
would have sunk in the scale.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother!' exclaimed Mehalah, intensely moved,
'you did all this for me; you thought and cared for
</span><em class="italics">me</em><span>—for </span><em class="italics">me</em><span>!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The idea of her mother having ever done anything
for her, ever having thought of her, apart from herself,
of having provided for her independently of herself,
was too strange and too amazing for Mehalah to take it
in at once.  As long as she remembered anything she
had worked for her mother, thought for her, and denied
herself for her, without expecting any return, taking it
as a matter of course that she should devote herself to
her mother without the other making any acknowledgment.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And now the thought that she had been mistaken,
that her mother had really cared for and provided for
her, overwhelmed her.  She had not wept when she
thought that George De Witt was lost to her, but now
she dropped into her chair, buried her face in her arms,
and burst into a storm of sobs and tears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland looked at her with a puzzled face.
She never had understood Mehalah, and she was content
to be in the dark as to what was passing in her breast
now.  She settled back in her chair, and turned back
to the thoughts of Charles Pettican's gilt balcony, and
petticoated dressing-table.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>By degrees Mehalah recovered her composure, then
she went up to her mother and kissed her passionately
on the brow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother dear,' she said in a broken voice, 'I never,
never will desert you.  Whatever happens, our lot shall
be cast together.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then she reared herself, and in a moment was firm
of foot, erect of carriage, rough and imperious as of old.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must look after the sheep on the saltings,' she
said.  'Abraham's head is turned with the doings here
to-day, and he has gone to the Rose to talk and drink
it over.  The moon is full, and we shall have a high tide.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Next moment Mrs. Sharland was alone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The widow heaved a sigh.  'There is no making
heads or tails of that girl, I don't understand her a bit,'
she muttered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do though,' answered Elijah Rebow at the door.
'I want a word with you, mistress.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I thought you had gone, Elijah, after the sale.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, I did not leave with the rest.  I hung about
in the marshes, waiting a chance when I might speak
with you by yourself.  I can't speak before Glory; she
flies out.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come in, master, and sit down.  Mehalah is gone
down to the saltings, and will not be back for an hour.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must have a word with you.  Where has Glory
been?  I saw her go off t'other day in gay Sunday
dress towards Fingringhoe.  What did she go after?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland raised herself proudly.  'I have a
cousin lives at Wyvenhoe, and we exchange civilities
now and then.  I can't go to him and he can't come
to me, so Mehalah passes between us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What does she go there for?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My cousin, Mr. Charles Pettican—I dare say you
have heard the name, it is a name that is honoured at
the bank——' she paused and pursed up her lips.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go on, I have heard of him, an old shipbuilder.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He made his fortune in shipbuilding,' said
Mrs. Sharland.  'He has laid by a good deal of money, and
is a free and liberal man with it, among his near
relatives.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Curse him,' growled Elijah, 'he let you have the
money?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I sent Mehalah to my cousin Charles, to ask him
to lend me a trifle, being for a moment inconvenienced,'
said Mrs. Sharland with stateliness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She—Glory—went cringing for money to an old
shipbuilder!' exclaimed Rebow with fury in his face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She did not like doing so,' answered the widow,
'but I entreated her to put her prejudices in her pocket,
and do as I wished.  You see, Master Rebow, this was
not like asking strangers.  Charles is my cousin, my
nearest living relative, and some day, perhaps, there is
no knowing——' she winked, and nodded, and ruffled
up in her pride.  'We are his nearest of kin, and he is
an old man, much older than I am.  I am young
compared to him, and he is half-paralysed.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He gave the money without any difficulty or
demur?' asked Elijah, his face flaming.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He was most willing, anxious, I may say, to help.
You see, Master Rebow, he is well off, and has no other
relatives.  He is a man of fortune, and has a gilt
balcony before his house, and a real sofa in his sitting-room.
His name is engraved on brass on a plate on the door,
it commands respect and receives honour at the
Colchester Bank.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'So you are fawning on him, are you?' growled
Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He has real oil-paintings on his walls.  There's
some in water-colours, and some in worsted work, but
I make no count of them, but real oils, you know;
there's something to think of in that.  A man don't
break out into oil unless he has money in the bank at
command.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland was delighted with the opportunity
of airing her re-discovered cousin, and exalting his
splendour before some one other than her daughter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A valance all round his bed—there's luxury!' said
the widow, 'and that bed a whole tester.  As for his
dressing-table, it wears a better petticoat than I, pink
calico that looks like silk, and over it gauze, just like a
lady at an assembly ball, a real quality lady.  My cousin
is not one to see his Liddy—he calls me his pretty cousin
Liddy—my name before I was married was Vince, but
instead of Sharland it might have been Pettican, if all
had been as it ought.  I say cousin Charles is not the
man to see his relatives sold up stick and stock by such
as Mrs. De Witt.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You think if you can't pay me my rent, he will
help you again?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If I feel a little behind-hand, Master Rebow, I
shall not scruple sending Mehalah to him again.  Charles
is a man of kind and generous heart, and it is touching
how he clings to his own flesh and blood.  He has taken
a great affection for Mehalah.  He calls her niece, and
wants her to look on him as an uncle, but you know that
is not the real relationship.  He was my mother's only
brother's son, so we was first cousins, and he can only
be a cousin of some sort to Mehalah, can he?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh curse your cousinships!' broke in Elijah angrily.
'To what an extent can you count on his help?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To any amount,' said the widow, too elated to care
to limit her exaggeration.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How is Mehalah?  Is she more inclined to think
of me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She don't love me?' said Elijah with a laugh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I fear not, Elijah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She won't be disposed to take up her quarters at
Red Hall?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland sighed a negative.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Nor to bear with me near her all day?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, Elijah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, she won't,' said he with a jerky laugh, 'she won't
till she is made to.  She won't come to Red Hall till
she can't help it.  She won't live with me till I force
her to it.  Damn that cousin!  He stands in my path.
I will go see him.  There comes Mehalah, back from
the saltings.  I must be off.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My cousin is a man of importance,' observed
Mrs. Sharland, bridling up at Elijah's slighting remark.  'He
is not accustomed to be cursed.  Men with names that
the bank honours, and who have gilded balconies over
their doors, don't like it, they don't deserve it.'</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>A month after the interrupted auction, Elijah Rebow
appeared one day before Mr. Pettican's door at
Wyvenhoe.  The gull was screaming and flying at his feet.
His stick beat a loud summons on the door, but the
noise within was too considerable for the notices of a
visitor to be heard and responded to.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah remained grimly patient outside, with a
sardonic smile on his face, and amused himself with
tormenting the gull.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently the door flew open, and a dashing young
woman flung out, with cherry-coloured ribands in her
bonnet, and cherry colour in her cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'All right, Monie?' asked a voice from the balcony,
and then Elijah was aware of a young man in a blue
guernsey and a straw hat lounging over the balustrade,
between the figureheads, smoking a pipe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He has learned his place at last,' answered
Admonition; 'I never saw him so audacious before.  Come
along, Timothy.'  The young man disappeared, and
presently emerged at the door.  At the same time
a little withered face was visible at the window, with
a dab of putty, as it seemed, in the middle of it, but
which was probably a nose flattened against the glass.
Two little fists were also apparent shaken violently, and
a shrill voice screamed imprecations and vowed
vengeance behind the panes, utterly disregarded by
Admonition and Timothy, who stared at Elijah, and then
struck down the gravelled path without troubling
themselves to ask his business.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The door was left open, and Elijah entered, but stood
on the threshold, and looked after the pair as they
turned out of the garden-gate, and took the Colchester
road, laughing and talking, and Admonition tossing her
saucy head, in the direction of the face at the window,
and then taking the sailor's arm.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A wonderful transformation had taken place in
Mrs. Pettican's exterior as well as in her manner since her
marriage.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She had been a soft demure little body with melting
blue eyes and rich brown hair very smoothly laid on
either side of her brow—a modest brow with guilelessness
written on it—and the simplest little curls
beside her round cheeks.  She wore only black, in
memory of a never-to-be-forgotten mother, and a neat
white cap and apron.  If she allowed herself a little
colour, it was only a flower in her bosom.  Poor Charles
Pettican!  How often he had supplied that flower!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can't pick one myself, Admonition,' he had said;
'you go into my garden and pluck a rose.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But </span><em class="italics">you</em><span> must give it me,' she had invariably said
on such occasions, with a shy eye just lifted, and then
dropped again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And of course Mr. Pettican had presented the
flower with a compliment, and an allusion to her cheek,
which had always deepened the modest flush in it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now Admonition affected bright colours—cherry
was her favourite.  She who had formerly dressed below
her position, now dressed above it; she was this day
flashing through Wyvenhoe in a straw broad-brimmed
hat with crimson bows, lined with crimson, and in a
white dress adorned with carnation knots, and a red
handkerchief over the shoulders worn bare in the house.
There was no doubt about it, that Admonition looked
very well thus attired, better even than in her black.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her hair was now frizzled over her brow, and she wore
a mass of curls about her neck, confined in the house
by a carnation riband.  The soft eyes were now
marvellously hard when directed upon the husband, and only
retained their velvet for Timothy.  The cheek now
blushed at nothing, but flamed at the least opposition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I married one woman and got another,' said Charles
Pettican to himself many times a day.  'I can't make
it out at all.  Marriage to a woman is, I suppose, much
like a hot bath to a baby; it brings out all the bad
humours in the blood.  Young girls are as alike as flour
and plaster of Paris, and it is not till you begin to be
the making of them that you find the difference.  Some
make into bread, but others make into stone.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When Elijah Rebow entered the little parlour, he
found Mr. Pettican nearly choked with passion.  He
was ripping at his cravat to get it off, and obtain air.
His face was nearly purple.  He took no notice of his
visitor for a few moments, but continued shaking his
fist at the window, and then dragging at his neckcloth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Being unable to turn himself about, the unfortunate
man nearly strangled himself in his inability to unwind
his cravat.  This increased his anger, and he screamed
and choked convulsively.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will smother yourself soon,' observed Elijah
dryly, and going up to Mr. Pettican, he loosened the
neckcloth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The cripple lay back and panted.  Presently he was
sufficiently recovered to project his head towards Rebow,
and ask him what he wanted, and who he was.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah told him his name.  Charles Pettican did not
pay attention to him; his mind was engrossed by other
matters.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come here,' said he, 'here, beside me.  Do you see
them?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'See what?' asked Elijah in return, gruffly, as
Pettican caught his arm, and drew him down, and pointed
out of the window.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There they are.  Isn't it wexing to the last degree
of madness?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you mean your daughter and her sweetheart?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Daughter!' echoed the cripple.  'Daughter!  I
wish she was.  No, she's my wife.  I don't mean her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you mean then?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, my crutches.  Don't you see them?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, I do not,' answered Rebow looking round the room.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They are not here,' said Pettican.  'Admonition
flew out upon me, because I wouldn't draw more money
from the bank, and she took away my crutches, to
confine me till I came into her whimsies.  There they are.
They are flying at the mast-head.  She got that cousin
of hers to hoist them.  She knows I can't reach them,
that here I must lie till somebody fetches them down for
me.  You should have heard how they laughed, those
cousins as they call themselves, as my crutches went
aloft.  Oh! it was fun to them, and they could giggle and
cut jokes about me sitting here, flattening my nose at
the pane, and seeing my crutches hoisted.  They might
as well have robbed me of my legs—better, for they are
of no use, and my crutches are.  Fetch me them down.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah consented, chuckling to himself at the distress
of the unfortunate shipbuilder.  He speedily ran the
crutches down, and returned them to Pettican.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Turning me into fun before the whole town!'
growled Pettican, 'exposing my infirmity to all the
world!  It was my wife did it.  Admonition urged on
her precious cousin Timothy to it.  He did fare to be
ashamed, but she laughed him into it, just as Eve
jeered Adam into eating the apple.  She has turned off
my servant too, and here am I left alone and helpless in
the house all day, whilst she is dancing off to Colchester
market with her beau—cousin indeed!  What do you
think, master—I don't know your name.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah Rebow, of Red Hall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you think, Master Rebow?  That cousin
has been staying here a month, a whole calendar month.
He has been given the best room, and there have been
junketings without number; they have ate all the oysters
out of my pan, and drank up all my old stout, and broken
the necks of half the whisky bottles in my cellar, and
smoked out all my havannahs.  I have a few boxes, and
indulge myself occasionally in a good cigar, they come
costly.  Well, will you believe me!  Admonition routs
out all my boxes, and gives her beau a havannah twice
a day or more often, as he likes, and I haven't had one
between my lips since he came inside my doors.  That
lot of old Scotch whisky I had down from Dundee is all
drunk out.  Before I married her, Admonition would
touch nothing but water, and tea very weak only coloured
with the leaf; now she sucks stout and rum punch and
whisky like a fish.  It is a wonder to me she don't smoke too.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The cripple tucked his recovered crutches under his
arms, rolled himself off his chair, and stumped vehemently
half a dozen times round the room.  He returned
at length, out of breath and very hot, to his chair, into
which he cast himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Put up my legs, please,' he begged of Elijah.
'There!' he said, 'I have worked off my excitement a
little.  Now go into the hall and look in the box under
the stairs, there you will find an Union Jack.  Run it
up to the top of the mast.  I don't care.  I will defy
her.  When that girl who came here the other day—I
forget her name—sees the flag flying she will come and
help me.  If Admonition has cousins, so have I, and
mine are real cousins.  I doubt but those of Admonition
are nothing of the sort.  If that girl——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What girl?' asked Rebow gloomily, as he folded his
arms across his breast, and scowled at Charles Pettican.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't know her name, but it is written down.  I
have it in my note-book—Ah!  Mehalah Sharland.
She is my cousin, her mother is my cousin.  I'll tell you
what I will do, master.  But before I say another word,
you go up for me into the best bed-room—the blue room,
and chuck that fellow's things out of the window over
the balcony, and let the gull have the pecking and
tearing of them to pieces.  I know he has his best jacket
on his back; more's the pity.  I should like the gull to
have the clawing and the beaking of that, but he can
make a tidy mess of his other traps; and will do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory——' began Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ah! you are right there,' said Pettican.  'It will
be glory to have routed cousin Timothy out of the house;
and if the flag flies, my cousin—I forget her name—Oh!
I see, Mehalah—will come here and bring her mother,
and before Master Timothy returns with Admonition
from market—they are going to have a shilling's worth
on a merry-go-round, I heard them scheme it—my
cousins will be in possession, and cousin Timothy must
content himself with the balcony, or cruise off.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory—or Mehalah, as you call her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'll not listen to another word, till you have
chucked that fellow's trape overboard.  There's a
portmantle of his up there, chuck that over with the rest,
and let the gull have the opening and examination of
the contents.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was nothing for it but compliance, if Elijah
wished to speak on the object of his visit.  The old man
was in an excited condition which would not allow him
to compose his mind till his caprices were attended to,
and his orders carried out.  Rebow accordingly went
upstairs and emptied the room of all evidences of its
having been occupied.  There was a discharge of boots,
brush, clothes, pipes, into the garden, at which Pettican
rubbed his hands and clucked like a fowl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow returned to the parlour, and the old shipbuilder
was profuse in his thanks.  'Now,' said he, 'run
the flag up.  You haven't done that yet.  Then come
and have a glass of spirits.  There is some of the whisky
left, not many bottles, but there is some, and not locked
up, for Admonition thought she had me safe when she
hoisted my crutches up the mast-head.  Go now and let
the bunting float as of old in my halcyon days.'  This
was also done; the wind took, unfurled, and flapped the
Union Jack, and the old man crowed with delight, and
swung his arms.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is right.  I haven't seen it fly for many
months; not since I was married.  Now that girl, I
forget her name, oh!  I have it here—Mehalah—will
see it, and come to the rescue.  Do you know her?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That ain't her name.  Her name is—is—Mehalah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We call her Glory.  She is the girl.  I know her,'
he laughed and his eyes glittered.  He set his teeth.
Charles Pettican looked at him, and thought he had
never seen a more forbidding countenance.  He was
frightened, and asked hastily,</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who are you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am Elijah Rebow, of Red Hall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't know you or the place.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am in Salcott and Virley.  You know me by name.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh! perhaps I do.  My memory is not what it once
was.  I get so put out by my wife's whimsies that I can't
collect my faculties all at once.  I think I may have
heard of you, but I haven't met you before.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am the landlord of Glory—Mehalah, you call her.
The Ray, which is their farm, belongs to me, with all the
marshes and the saltings, and all that thereon is.  I
bought it for eight hundred pounds.  Glory and her
mother are mine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't understand you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I bought the land, and the farm, and them, a job
lot, for eight hundred pounds.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I remember, the girl—I forget her name, but I
have it here, written down——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, not that, Mehalah.  I wish you wouldn't call
her what she is not, because it confuses me; and I have
had a deal to confuse me lately.  Marriage does
rummage a man's hold up so.  Mehalah came here a few
weeks back to ask me to lend her some money, as her
mother could not pay the rent.  Her mother is my
cousin, Liddy Vince that was, I used to call her "Pretty
Liddy," or Lydia Languish, after a character in a play,
because of her ague, and because she sort of languished
of love for me.  And I don't deny it, I was sweet on her
once, but the ague shivers stood in the way of our love
waxing wery hot.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You lent her the money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I—I——' hesitated Mr. Pettican.  'You see how
I am circumstanced, my wife——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You lent her the money.  Mistress Sharland told
me so.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She did!' exclaimed Pettican in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, she did.  Now I want to know, will you do
that again?  I am landlord.  I bought the Ray for
eight hundred pounds, and I don't want to drop my
money without a return.  You understand that.  A
man doesn't want to give his gold away, and be whined
out of getting interest for it by an old shivering,
chattering woman, and flouted out of it by a devil of a
girl.'  His hands clenched fiercely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Of course, of course,' said the cripple.  'I
understand you.  You think those two can't manage the farm,
and were better out of it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I want to be sure of my money,' said Elijah, knitting
his dark brows, and fixing his eyes intently on Pettican.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I quite understand,' said the latter, and tapping
his forehead, he added, 'I am a man of business still.
I am not so old as all that, whatever Admonition may say.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now what I want to know,' pursued Elijah, 'is this—for
how long are you going to pay your cousin's rent?
For how long is that Glory to come to me and defy me,
and throw the money down before me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't quite take you,' said Pettican.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How many times will you pay their rent?' asked
Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well!' said the cripple, passing his hand over his
face.  'I don't want them to stay at your farm at all.
I want them to come here and take care of me.  I
cannot defend myself.  If I try to be a man—that girl, I
forget her name, you confuse me about it—told me to
be a man, and I will be a man, if she will back me up.
I have been a man somewhat, have I not, master, in
chucking cousin Timothy's traps to the gull—that I call
manly.  You will see the girl—-Mehalah—I have the
name now.  I will keep my note-book open at the place.
Mehalah, Mehalah, Mehalah, Mehalah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I want to know——' broke in Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me repeat the name ten times, and then I shall
not forget it again.'  Pettican did so.  'You called her
something else.  Perhaps we are not speaking of the
same person.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, we are.  I call her Glory.  I am accustomed
to that name.  Tell me what you want with her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I want her and her mother to come and live with
me, and take care of me, and then I can be a man, and
make head against the wind that is now blowing in my
teeth.  Shall you see them?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To-day?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Perhaps.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then pray make a point of seeing the girl or her
mother, in case she should not notice the flag, and say
that I wish them to come here at once; at once it must
be, or I shall never have courage to play the man again,
not as I have to-day.  They did put my monkey up by
removing my crutches and hoisting them to the masthead,
leaving me all by myself and helpless here.  I should
wish Mehalah to be here before Admonition and her beau
return.  They won't be back till late.  There's a
horsemanship at Colchester as well as a merry-go-round, and
they are going to both, and perhaps to the theatre
after that.  There'll be junketings and racketings, and
I—poor I—left here with no one to attend to me, and
my crutches at the mast-head.  You will tell the girl
and her mother that I expect their help, and I will be
a man, that I will.  It would be something to boast
of, would it not, if Timothy were to return and find
his room occupied and his baggage picked to rags, and
if Admonition were to discover that I have cousins as
well as she?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are bent on this?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I rely on you.  You will see them and tell them to
come to me, and I will provide for them whilst I am
alive, and afterwards—when I am no more—we won't
talk or think of such an eventuality.  It isn't pleasant
to contemplate, and may not happen for many years.
I am not so old as you might think.  My infirmity is
due to accident; and my digestion is, or rather was,
first-rate.  I could eat and drink anything before I was
married.  Now I am condemned to see others eat and
drink what I have laid in for my own consumption, and
I am put off with the drumstick of the fowl, or the
poorest swipes of ale, whilst the others toss off my
stout—bottled stout.  I will not endure this any longer.
Tell that girl—I forget her name—and her mother that
they must come to me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But suppose they will not come.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They will, I know they will.  The female heart is
tender and sympathetic, and compassionates misery.
My suffering will induce them to come.  If that will
not, why then the prospects of being comfortably off
and free from cares will make them come.  I have
plenty of money.  I won't tell you, I have not told
Admonition, how much.  I have money in the Colchester
Bank.  I have South Sea shares, and insurances,
and mortgages, and I shall not let Admonition have
more money than I can help, as it all goes on cousin
Timothy, and whirligigs and horsemanships, or regattas,
and red ribands, and what not; none is spent on me.
No, no.  The Sharlands shall have my money.  They
are my cousins.  I have cousins as well as Admonition.
I will be a man and show that I have courage too.  But I
have another inducement that will be sure to bring them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is that?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have observed,' said Pettican, with a hiccuppy
giggle, 'that just as tom-cats will range all over the
country in search of other tom-cats, just for the pleasure
of clawing them and tearing out their hair, so women
will hunt the whole country-side for other women, if
there be a chance of fighting them.  Tell my cousin
Liddy that Admonition is game, she has teeth, and
tongue, and nails, and sets up her back in a corner, and
likes a scrimmage above everything, and my word for
it, Liddy—unless the ague has taken the female nature
out of her—will be here before nightfall to try her
teeth, and tongue, and nails on Admonition.  It is said
that if on a May morning you rub your eyes with cuckoo
spittle, you see things invisible before, the fairies in the
hoes dancing and feasting, swimming in eggshells on
the water to bore holes in ships' sides, milking the cows
before the maids come with the pail, and stealing the
honey from the hives.  Well, marriage does much the
same sort of thing to a man as salving his eyes in
cuckoo spittle; it affords him a vision of a world
undreamt of before; it gives him an insight into what is
going on in the female world, and the workings and
brewings and the mischief in women's hearts.  Tell
Liddy Sharland about my Admonition, and she will be
here, with all her guns run out and ready charged,
before nightfall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow shook his head.  'Mistress Sharland and
Glory won't come.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't say so.  They must, or I shall be undone.
I cannot live as I have, tyrannised over, insulted,
trampled on by Admonition and her cousin.  I will no
longer endure it.  The flag is flying.  I have proclaimed
my independence and defiance.  But, as you see, I am
unable to live alone.  If Liddy and her daughter will
not come to me, I shall be driven to do something
desperate.  My life has become intolerable, I will bear
with Admonition no longer.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What will you do?' asked Elijah with a sneer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I tell you, I do not care.  I am reckless, I will
even fire the house, and burn it over their heads.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What good would that do?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What good would it do?' repeated Pettican.  'It
would no longer be a shelter for Admonition and that
beau Timothy.  I am not going to be trifled with, I
have endured too much.  I will be a man.  I shouldn't
mind a bit smoking them out of this snug lair.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And what about yourself?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, as for me, I could go to the Blue Anchor, and
put up there for the rest of my days.  I think I could
be happy in a tavern, happier than here, and I should
have the satisfaction of thinking I had shaken the
weevils out of the biscuit.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah started, and strode up and down the room,
with head bent, and his eyes fixed on the floor.  His
hands were clenched and rigid at his side.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will tell Liddy,' said the cripple, watching him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Smoke them out!  Ha! ha! that is a fine idea!'
burst forth from Elijah, with a laugh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will tell Liddy,' repeated Charles Pettican.
'You must, you know, or I am lost.  If Admonition
were to return with Timothy at her heels, and were to
find the flag flying, and me alone——' he passed his
agitated hand over his face, and his lips trembled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I see,' said Rebow.  'You would then cease to be a man.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was late when Admonition and her cousin returned
from the market.  It was so dark that they did not see
the flag.  But as Admonition put her hand on the gate
it was grasped.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Stop,' said Elijah.  'A word with you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who are you?' asked Mrs. Pettican in alarm, and
Timothy swaggered forward to her defence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never mind who I am.  I have waited here some
hours to warn you.  Was there a girl, a handsome girl,
a glorious girl, here to see that man, your husband, a
month ago?  You need not answer.  I know there was.
She is his cousin.  He lent her money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, he did not.  I stopped that, didn't I, Tim?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He lent her money.  You think you stopped that,
but you did not.  He let her have the money, twenty
pounds, how I know not.  She had his money, and she
will have more, </span><em class="italics">all</em><span>, unless you keep a sharp watch on him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Tim! do you hear this?' asked Admonition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He will send for his cousin to live in the house
with him, and to support him against you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, oh!  That's fine, isn't it, Tim?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If they come, your reign is at an end.  That girl,
Glory, has a head of iron and the heart of a lion.  No
one can stand against her but one.  There is only one
in all the world has dared to conquer her, and he will
do it yet.  Don't you think you will be able to lift a
little finger against her will.  She will be too strong for
you and a hundred of your Timothys.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Admonition laughed.  'My little mannikin daren't
do it.  He is under my thumb.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The flag is flying,' sneered Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At that moment the faint light of evening broke
through the clouds and Admonition saw the Union Jack
at the mast-head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He is right.  There is audacity!  Run, Tim, haul
it down, and bring it me.  It shall go into the kitchen
fire to boil the water for a glass of grog.'</span></p>
