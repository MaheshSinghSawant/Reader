<p class="pfirst"><span>A month passed, and no tidings whatever of George
De Witt had reached his mother or Mehalah.  The
former constantly expected news of her son.  She would
not believe in his death, and was encouraged in her
opinion by Isaac Mead.  But Mehalah had never entertained
hope; she did not look for news, she knew that
George was drowned.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>His body had not been found.  His disappearance
had been altogether mysterious.  Mrs. De Witt used
every effort to trace him, but failed.  From the moment
the door of the Mussets had closed upon him, no one
had seen him.  With the closing of that door the record
of his life had closed.  He had passed as completely
beyond pursuit as though he had passed through the
gate of death.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was but one possible way of accounting for his
disappearance, and it was that at which public opinion
arrived.  He had gone round by the Strood from Mersea
to reach the Ray, which was on that side accessible, but
with difficulty, and occasionally only by land, had lost
his way among the saltmarshes in the night, had fallen
into one of the myriad creeks that traverse this desolate
region, and had been engulfed in the ooze.  The sea will
give up her dead after a storm and with the tide, but
the slime of the marshes never.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah made no attempt to account for the disappearance
of George; it was sufficient for her that he
was lost to her for ever.  But his mother made enquiries
when selling shrimps along the Colchester road, and on
the island.  He had nowhere been seen.  He had not
visited the Rose.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was Elijah Rebow who finally brought Mrs. De
Witt to admit that her son was entirely lost to her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He visited her in November.  She was surprised
and pleased to see him.  Since the disappearance of
George, Mrs. De Witt had taken more vigorously than
before to grog.  Her feelings needed solace, and she
found it in her glass.  Perhaps the presence of George had
acted as a restraint on his mother.  She had not wished
him to suppose her a habitual tippler.  Her libations
had been performed when he was away, or under the
excuse of stomachics.  On the subject of her internal
arrangements, discomforts, and requirements, Mrs. De
Witt had afforded her son information more copious
than interesting.  Her digestion sympathised with all
the convulsions then shaking Europe.  Revolutions were
brought about there by the most ordinary edibles, and
were always to be reduced by spirituous drinkables.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The topic of her internal economy, when introduced
by Mrs. De Witt, always prefaced a resolve to try a drop
of cordial.  Now that George was gone, Mrs. De Witt
brooded over her loss at home, stirring her glass as if it
were the mud of the marshes, and she hoped to turn
George up out of the syrup of the dissolving sugar.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt had laid aside her red coat, as
inappropriate to her forlorn condition.  The month of
October had seen a sad deterioration in the mistress of
the 'Pandora.'  Her funds had been fast ebbing.  The
bread-winner was gone, and the rum-drinker had
obtained fresh excuse for deep potations.  There were fish
in the sea to be caught, but he that had netted them
was now under the mud.  Things could not go on thus
for ever.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt was musing despondingly over her
desperate position, when Elijah appeared above the
hatchway and descended to the cabin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt had stuck a black bow in her mob
cap, as a symbol of her woe.  She hardly needed to
hang out the flag, for her whole face and figure
betokened distress.  It cannot be said that her maternal
bowels yearned after her son out of love for him so much
as out of solicitude for herself.  She naturally grieved
for her 'poor boy,' but her grief for him was largely
tinctured with anxiety for her own future.  How should
she live?  On what subsist?  She had her husband's
old hull as a home, and a fishing smack, and a
rowing boat.  There was some money in the box, but not
much.  'There's been no wasteful outlay over a burying,'
said Mrs. De Witt.  'That is a good job.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But, as already said, Mrs. De Witt only yielded
reluctantly to the opinion that her boy was drowned.
She held resolutely in public to this view for reasons
she confided to herself over her rum.  'It is no use
dropping a pint of money in dragging for the body, and
burying it when you've got it.  To my notion that is
laying out five pound to have the satisfaction of
spending another five.  George was a gentleman,' she said
with pride.  'If he was to go from his pore mother, he
went as cheap from her as a lad could do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Another reason why she refused to believe in his
death was characteristic of the illogicality of her sex.
This she announced to Rebow.  'You have it in a
nutshell.  How can the poor boy be drowned?  For, if so,
what is to become of me, and I a widow?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mrs. De Witt,' said Rebow, helping himself to
some rum, 'you may as well make your mind easy on
this point.  If George be not dead where can he be?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That I do not take on myself to say.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He is nowhere on Mersea, is he?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Certainly not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He did not go along the Colchester road beyond
the Strood?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, or I should have heard of him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Moreover, he told me he purposed going to the Ray.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To be sure he did.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And he never reached the Ray.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, for certain.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then it is obvious he must have been lost between
Mersea and the Ray.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is something in what you say, Elijah; there
is what we may term argument in it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There was a reason why he should go to the Ray.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I suppose there was.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He had quarrelled with Glory, and desired to make
it up that night.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I know there had been a squall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then do not flatter yourself with false hopes.
George is gone past recall; you and Glory must give
him up for ever.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt shook her head, wiped her eyes with
the frill of her cap, looked sorrowfully into her glass
and said, 'Pore me!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are poor indeed,' said Elijah, 'but how poor I
suspect rather than know.  What have you got to live
upon?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is just it,' answered Mrs. De Witt; 'my head
has been like the Swin light, a rewolving and a rewolving.
But there is this difference, the Swin rewolves first light
and then dark alternately, whereas in my head there
has been naught rewolving but warious degrees of
darkness.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you propose doing?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, I have an idea.' Mrs. De Witt hitched her
chair nearer to her nephew, and breathed her idea and
her spirit together into his ear.  'I think I shall
marry.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You——!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, I.  Why not?  There is the billyboy running
to waste, rotting for want of use, crying out for a
master to take her out fishing.  There are as many
fisher-boys on shore as there are sharks in the ocean, ready to
snap me up were I flung to them.  I have felt them.
They have been a-nibbling round me already.  Consider,
Elijah! there is the "Pandora," good as a palace for a
home, and the billyboy and the boat, and the nets, and
the oyster garden, and then there is my experience to
be thrown in </span><em class="italics">gratis</em><span>, and above all,' she raised herself,
'there is my person.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow laughed contemptuously.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What have these boys of their own?' asked Mrs. De
Witt, laying down the proposition with her spoon.
'They have nothing, no more than the sea-cobs.  They
have naught to do but swoop down on whatever they
can see, sprats, smelt, mullet, whiting, dabs, and when
there is naught else, winkles.  Their thoughts do not
rise that proudly to me, and I must stoop to them.  I
tell you what, Elijah, if I was to be raffled for, at
a shilling a ticket, there would be that run among
the boys for me, that I could make a fortune.  But
I won't demean myself to that.  I shall choose the
stoutest and healthiest among them, then I can send
him out fishing, and he can earn me money, as did
George, and so I shall be able to enjoy ease, if not
opulence.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But suppose the lads decline the honour.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I should like to see the impertinence of the lad
that did,' said Mrs. De Witt firmly.  'I have had
experience with men, and I know them in and out that
familiarly that I could find my way about their brains
or heart, as you would about your marshes, in the dark.
No, Elijah, the question is not will they have me, but
whether I will be bothered with any more of the
creatures.  I will not unless I can help it.  I will not
unless the worst comes to the worst.  But a woman
must live, Elijah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How much have you got for current expenses?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Only a few pounds.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There are five and twenty pounds owed you by
the Sharlands.  You are not going to let them have it
as a present?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, certain, I am not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you expect to get it by waiting for it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To tell you the truth, Elijah, I hadn't given that
five and twenty pounds a thought.  I will go over to
the Ray and claim the money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will not get it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must have it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They cannot possibly pay.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But they shall pay.  I want and will have my
money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah will pretend that George gave her the
money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, she will not.  She acknowledged the debt to
me before George's face.  She promised repayment as
soon as she had sufficient.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you do not seize on their goods, or some of
them, you will never see the colour of the coin again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must and will have it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then follow my advice.  Put in an execution.  I
will lend you my men.  All you have to do is to give
notice on this island when the sale is to be, get together
sufficient to bid and buy, and you have your money.
You must have an auction.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Can I do so, Elijah?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Of course you can.  Go over to the Ray at once
and demand your money.  If they decline to pay, allow
them a week's grace, more if you like.  I'll go with
you, when the sale is to take place, and perhaps bid.
We will have a Dutch auction.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'By cock!  I'll do it.  I will go there right on end.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At once, with her natural impetuosity, the old
woman started.  Before departing, however, to heighten
her importance, and give authority and sternness to her
appearance, she donned her red coat.  In token of
mourning she wrapped a black rag round her left arm.
Over her cap she put a broad-brimmed battered straw
hat, in front of which she affixed with a hair-pin the
large black bow that had figured on her cap.  Thus
arrayed she entered her boat and rowed to the Ray.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The demand for the money filled Mrs. Sharland
with dismay.  It was a demand as unexpected as it was
embarrassing.  She and Mehalah were absolutely
without the means of discharging the debt.  They had,
indeed, a few pounds by them, which had been intended
to serve to carry them through the winter, and these
they offered Mrs. De Witt, but she refused to receive
a portion on account when she wanted the whole of the
debt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland entreated delay till spring, but
Mrs. De Witt was inexorable.  She would allow no longer
than a week.  She departed, declaring that she would
sell them up, unless the five and twenty pounds were
produced.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Since the death or disappearance of George De
Witt, Mehalah had gone about her usual work in a
mechanical manner.  She was in mourning also.  But
she did not exhibit it by a black bow on her cap or a
sable rag round her arm, like the mother of the lost
lad.  She still wore her red cap, crimson kerchief and
blue jersey.  But the lustre was gone from her eyes,
the bloom from her cheek, animation from her lips.
There was no spring in her step, no lightness in her
tone.  The cow was milked as regularly as usual, and
foddered as attentively as before.  The house was kept
as scrupulously clean, Mrs. Sharland ministered to with
the same assiduity, but the imperiousness of Mehalah's
nature had gone.  The widow found to her astonishment
that she was allowed to direct what was to be
done, and that her daughter submitted without an
objection.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is the way with strong natures to allow their
griefs no expression, to hide their sorrows and mask
their wounds.  Glory did not speak of George.  She
did not weep.  She made no lamentation over his loss;
more wonderful still in her mother's eyes, she uttered
no reproaches against anyone for it.  A weak nature
always exhausts its troubles in reproaches of others; a
strong one eats out its own heart.  Mehalah listened
with a dull ear to her mother's murmurs, and made
no response.  Mrs. Sharland set her down as unfeeling.
A feeble querulous woman like her was quite unable to
measure the depth of her daughter's heart, and understand
its working.  The result was that she read them
wrong, and took false soundings.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When her mother was in bed and asleep, then
Mehalah sat at the hearth, or leaned at the window
looking at the stars, hour by hour, immovable, uttering
no sound, not building castles in the clouds, not weaving
any schemes for her future, not hoping for anything,
not imagining anything, but exhaling her pain.  As
the turned earth after the plough may be seen in a
sudden frost to smoke, so was it with that wounded
heart, it smoked, gave up its fever heat, and in silence
and solitude cooled.  There was something, which yet
was no </span><em class="italics">thing</em><span>, to which her weary soul stretched, in dim
unconsciousness.  There was a communing without
words, even without the thoughts which form into
words, with that Unseen which is yet so surely felt.
It was the spirit—that infinite essence so mysteriously
enclosed within bounds, in strange contradiction to its
nature, asserting its nature and yearning for Infinity.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The human heart in suffering is like the parched
soil in summer; when its sky is overcast and it cannot
see beyond the cloud that lies low over it, then it must
harbour its heat, and gape with fever.  But, should a
rent appear in the earthborn vaporous veil, through
which it can look into unfathomable space, at once it
radiates the ardour that consumes it, casts off the fever
that consumes it, and drinks in, and is slaked by, the
dew of heaven.</span></p>

<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold medium">STRUCK COLOURS.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Woman is the natural enemy of woman.  When one
woman is over thirty or plain, and the other is young
or beautiful, the enmity on one side is implacable and
unqualified by mercy.  A woman can be heroically
self-sacrificing and behave with magnificent generosity
towards man, but not towards one of her own sex.
She is like the pillar that accompanied the Israelites
and confounded the Egyptians; she is cloud and darkness
to these, but light and fire to those.  She will
remorselessly pursue, and vindictively torment a sister
who offends by having a better profile and less age.
No act of submission will blunt her spite, no deed of
kindness sponge up her venom.  There is but one
unpardonable sin in the sight of Heaven; there are
two in the eyes of a middle-aged woman, youth
and beauty.  She is unconscious of fatigue in the
pursuit, and without compunction in the treatment of
the member of her sex who has sinned against her in
one particular or other.  The eternal laws of justice,
the elementary principles of virtue, are set aside as
inappropriate to the world of women.  Generosity,
charity, pity are unknown quantities in the feminine
equation.  As the Roman tyrant wished that mankind
had but one neck which he might hack through, so
woman would like that womankind had but one nose
which she might put out of joint.  Every woman is a
kill-joy to every other woman, a discord in the universal
harmony.  Her ideal world is that of the bees, in
which there is but one queen, and all other shes are
stung to death.  Eve was the only woman who tasted
of happiness unalloyed, because in Eden she had no
sisters.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The iron maid of Nuremberg was sweet and smiling
externally, but a touch revealed the interior bristling
with spikes, and the victim thrust into her embrace
was only released a corpse to drop into an </span><em class="italics">oubliette</em><span>.
All women are Nuremberg maidens, with more or
fewer spikes, discovered perhaps by husbands,
unsuspected by the rest of men, but known to all other
women, who are scarred from their embraces.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah knew that no leniency was to be looked
for in Mrs. De Witt.  She thought that lady exceptionally
rigorous and exacting; she thought so because she
knew nothing of the world.  Her mother spent her
breath in repinings that could not help, and in hopes
which must be frustrated.  The extremity of the
danger roused Mehalah from her dreams.  There was
no pity to be expected from the creditor, and there
was no means that she could see of defraying the debt.
She considered and tried to find some road out of the
difficulty, but could discover none.  Now more than
ever did she need the advice, if not the help, of him
who was gone.  There was nothing on the farm that
could be sold without leaving them destitute of means
of carrying it on and defraying the next half-year's
rent.  The cow, the ewes, her boat, were necessary to
them.  The furniture in the house was of little value,
and it was impossible for her to transport it to
Colchester for sale.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She sat thinking of the situation one evening over
the fire opposite her mother, without uttering a word.
Her hands with her knitting needles lay in her lap; she
could not work, she was too fully engrossed in the cares
which pressed on her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently her mother roused her from her reverie, by
saying, 'There is no help for it, Mehalah, you must go
to Wyvenhoe, and find out my cousin, Charles Pettican.
He is my only relative left;—at least as far as I know,
and him I have not seen for fifteen or sixteen years.  I
do not even know if he be yet alive.  We haven't had
a chance of meeting.  I go nowhere, I am imprisoned
on this island, and he is cut off from us by the river
Colne.  I see no way out of our trouble but that of
borrowing money from him.  He was a kind-hearted
lively fellow when young, but what he is now that he is
old I cannot tell.  You must go and try what you can
do with him.  He is well off, and would not miss twenty
pounds more than twenty pence.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah greatly disliked the idea of going to a
stranger, to one who, though a connection, was quite
unknown to her, and begging a loan of him.  It galled
her pride and wounded her independence.  It lowered
her in her own eyes.  She would rather have worked her
fingers to the bone than so stoop, but no work of hers
could raise twenty pounds in a week.  The thought was
altogether so intolerable to her, that she fought against
it as long as she could.  She would herself cheerfully
have gone out of her home and left the farm rather than
do this, but she was obliged to consider her mother.
She yielded at last most reluctantly; and with tears of
mortification filling her eyes, and her cheeks burning
with shame, she threw aside her customary costume, and
dressed herself in dark blue cloth gown, white kerchief,
and a bonnet, and took her way to Wyvenhoe.  She had
to walk some seven miles.  Her road led her to the top
of high ground overlooking the mouth of the Colne.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The blue water was dotted with sails.  Beyond the
river on a height rose from above trees the lofty tower
of Brightlingsea.  Up a winding creek she looked, and
at the head could distinguish the grey priory of
St. Osyth, then the seat of the Earl of Rochford, at the
entrance to a noble park.  She descended the hill, and
by a ferry crossed the river to the village of Wyvenhoe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On her walk she had mused over what she should say
to Mr. Charles Pettican, without coming to any
determination.  Her mother had let fall some hints that her
cousin had once been her fond admirer, but that they
had been parted by cruel parents.  Mrs. Sharland's
reminiscences were rather vague, and not much reliance
could be placed on them; however, Mehalah hoped there
might be some truth in this, and that old recollections
might be stirred in the breast of Mr. Pettican, and
stimulate him to generosity.  The river was full of
boats, and on the landing were a number of people.
'We're lively to-day,' said the ferryman who put her
over, 'the regatta is on.  It is late this season, but what
with one thing and another, we couldn't have it earlier
no way.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Will Mr. Pettican be there?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Lor bless you, no,' answered the man, 'that's
impossible.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Glory asked her way to the house of her mother's
cousin.  He was, or rather had been, a shipbuilder.
He occupied a little compact wooden house painted
white, on the outskirts of the village.  It was a cheerful
place.  The shutters were after the French fashion,
external, and painted emerald green.  The roof was tiled
and looked very red, as though red ochred every morning
by the housemaid after she had pipeclayed the walls.
Over the door of the house was a balcony with elaborate
iron balustrades gilt; against these leaned two figureheads,
females, with very pink and white complexions,
and no expression in their faces.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was a sanded path led from the gate to the
door, and there were two green patches of turf, one on
each side of it.  In the centre of that on the left was
another figure-head—a Medusa with flying serpent locks,
but with a face as passionless and ordinary as that of a
milliner's block.  In the midst of the other plot rose a
mast.  On this day, when all Wyvenhoe was </span><em class="italics">en fête</em><span>, a
flag ought properly to be flying from the mast.  Every
other in the village and on the water was adorned with
its bunting, but that of Mr. Pettican alone ignored the
festival.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As Mehalah ascended the walk, a gull with its wings
clipped uttered a fierce scream, and rushing across the
garden with outspread pinions, dashed at her foot with
his sharp beak, and then falling back, threw out his
breast, elevated his bill, and broke into a long succession
of discordant yells, whoops, and gulps.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the same moment one pane in the window on the
right of the door opened, a little dry face peered through
and nodded.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you're going to knock, don't.  Come in, and
make no noise about it.  It's very kind.  She's out.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The gull made a second assault at Mehalah's foot.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Kick him,' said the face; 'don't fear you will hurt
him.  He is as good as a watch dog.  Open the door,
and when you are in the hall turn to the right-hand.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then the pane was slammed to, and Mehalah turned
the handle of the front door.  She found herself in a
narrow passage with a flight of very steep stairs before
her, and a door on each hand.  Over each of these on
a bracket stood a ship fully rigged, with all her sail on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She entered the room on the right as directed, and
found herself in a little parlour with very white walls,
and portraits of ships, some in worsted work on canvas,
others painted in oils, others again in water-colours,
covering the walls.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the window, half sat, half reclined, an old man,
with a scrubby grey head, a pair of very lively eyes,
but with a trembling feeble mouth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He wore very high shirt-collars, exceedingly stiff, and
thick folds of black silk round his neck.  His blue coat
had a high black velvet collar.  The little man seemed
to draw his head in between his blinkers and beneath
his coat-collar, and lose his face in his cravat, then at
will to project his head from them, as though he were a
tortoise retiring into or emerging from his shell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As Glory came in, the little wizened face was scarce
perceptible, save that the bright eyes peeped and
twinkled at her from somewhere in a chaos of black
velvet, blue cloth, white linen, and black silk; then all
at once the head shot forward, and a cheery voice said,
'I can't rise to meet you, Mary,' he made at the same
time a salutation with his hand, 'or I would throw
myself at your feet.  Glad to see you.  How are you, Lizzy,
my dear.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My name is neither Mary nor Lizzy, but Mehalah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let it be Methuselah or Melchisedek, or what you
like, it is all one to me.  I don't care for the name you
give a wine when it is good, I drink it and smack my
lips, whether you call it Port, or Tarragona, or Roussillon;
and I don't bother about a girl's name.  If she is sweet
and sunny, and bright and pretty as'—he made a little
bow and a great flourish of his hand as a salute—'as
you are, I see her and listen to her, and admire her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My name's——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have told you it don't matter.  I never yet met
with a girl's name that wasn't pretty, except one, and I
thought that pretty once.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What name?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Admonition.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why do you not like it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The little man looked out of the window, along the
walls, then turned his head round and sighed.  'Never
mind.  Do you see that figure-head out there?  It
belonged to a wessel I built; she was called the
"Medusa."  Bad luck attended her.  She was always
fouling other wessels.  She ran down a Frenchman once,
but that was no matter, and she did the same by a
Dutchman.  Well, at last she got such a character that
I was forced to change her head and her name, but then
she fared worse than before.  Changing their names don't
always mend wessels and women.  Well!' with another
sigh, 'we will leave unpleasant topics, and laugh and be
jolly while we may.  You haven't told me how you are.
This is very kind of you to drop in on me.  It is like
old times; my halcyon days, as I think they call 'em.
I haven't had such a wisit since,' he waved towards his
flagstaff, 'since I lowered my flag.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But, sir,' said Mehalah, 'you must let me explain
my purpose in coming here; and to do that, I must
tell you who I am, and whence I come.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't want to hear it.  I don't care a bit about
it.  Be jolly and gather the rosebuds while you may.
She ain't out for long, and we must be joyful at such
opportunities as are afforded us.  I know as well as you
do why you have come.  You have come in the goodness
of your female heart to cheer a poor crippled wretch
like me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I did not know you were a cripple, sir!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You didn't.  Give me my crutches.  Look at this.'  He
placed his crutches under his arms, swung himself
dexterously off his chair, and stumped round the room,
dragging his lower limbs behind him, as though they
did not belong to him.  They were lifeless.  When he
returned to his seat he threw himself down.  'Now,
Jemima, put up my legs on that chair.  I can't stir
them myself.  I couldn't raise them an inch if you was
to promise me a kiss for my pains.  There, thank ye;
now sit down and be jolly.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sir,' said Mehalah, 'you remember my mother,
Mistress Sharland.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What!  Liddy Vince, pretty cousin Liddy!  I should
think I did remember her.  Why, it is only the other
day that she married.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am her daughter, and my age is nineteen.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I haven't seen her for—well, never mind how many
years.  Years don't tell on a man as they do on a
woman; they mellow him, but wither her.  So you are
her daughter, are you?  Stand round there by my feet
where I can see you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He drew his head down among his clothes and peered
at her from between his tall white collars.  'You are an
uncommon fine girl,' he said, when his observation was
completed, 'but not a bit like Liddy.  You are more
like her mother—she was the deuce of a splendid woman,
such eyes, such hair—but she was a——' he hesitated,
his courtesy forbade his saying what rose to the tongue.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A gipsy;' Mehalah supplied the words.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, she was, but she couldn't help it, you know.
But that is not what I was about to say.  I intended
to observe that she was a—little before my time.  She
was old when I knew her, but I've heard what a beauty
she was, and her eyes always remained large and noble,
and her hair luxuriant.  But women don't improve with
age as does good port, and as do men.  Well, now, tell
me your name.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A regular Essex marshland name.  I hope I shall
remember it.  But I have to carry so many names of
nice-looking girls in my head, and of ships I have built, that
they run one another down, and I cannot be sure to
recall them.  My memory is not going.  Don't suppose
that.  Why, bless your dear heart, I can remember
everything your mother and I said to one another when
we were sweet upon each other.  That don't look like a
failing memory, does it?  But you see, as we go on in
life, every day brings something more to remember, and
so this head gets choke full.  A babe a year old has
some three hundred and sixty-five things to recollect,
that is if he remembers only one thing per diem, and a
man of fifty has over eighteen million of things stuffed
away in this little warehouse,' tapping his head; 'so he
has to rummage and rout before he can find the particular
article he wants.  His memory don't go with age,
but gets overchoked.  Now, to change the topic, why
haven't you been to see me before?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sir!  I could not.  I did not know you, and you
live a long way from the Ray.  Mother cannot walk so far.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And I can't neither, but not from age but from
accident.  So your mother can't walk a matter of seven
miles.  Dear me!  How women do deteriorate either
with age or with marriage!  I could; I would think
nothing of it but for my accident.  Now tell me what
has brought you here, Mehalaleel?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have come,' answered Mehalah, looking down,
'because driven by necessity to apply to you, as our
only relative.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Bless my soul!  Want my help!  How?  I wish
I could as easily apply for yours.  My dear girl, I am
past help.  I've hauled down my flag.  All is up with
me.  I'm drawn up on the mud and put to auction.
They are breaking me up.  Tell your mother so.  Tell
her that time was—but let bygones be bygones.  How
is she looking?  Are the roses altogether faded?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is very feeble and suffering.  She is greatly
afflicted with ague.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She had it as a girl.  One day as I was courting
her and whispering pretty things in her ear, she was going
to blush and smile, when all at once the fit of shivers
came on her, and she could do nought but chatter her
teeth and turn green and stream with cold sweat.  So
she is very feeble, is she?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is weak and ailing.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Women never do improve, like men, by ripening,'
said Mr. Pettican.  'Girls are angels up to one and
twenty, some a little bit later, but after that they
deteriorate and become old cats.  They are roses up to
marriage and after that are hips, with hard red skins
outside and choke and roughness within.  Men are
quite the reverse.  They are louts to twenty-five, as
unformed in body as young colts, and in mind as young
owls; after that they begin to ripen, and the older they
get the better they grow.  A man is like a medlar, only
worth eating when rotten.  A young man is raw and
hard and indigestible, but a man of forty is full of juice
and sweetness.  Now don't tell your mother what I have
said about old women.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sit ye down, sit ye down, and be jolly.  Don't
stand.  It does not fare to be comfortable.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sir, I must mention the object of this visit.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'All in good time.  But first let us be jolly.  Give
me some fun, I haven't had any since—since,' he pointed
sadly to his flagless staff and shook his head.  'It is all
up with me, save when a stray gleam of liveliness and
mirth shoots athwart my gloomy sky.  But that is
rarely the case now.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Thank you, sir,' said Mehalah, taking a chair.
'Now to the point.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'First be jolly.  I have enough of mouths drawn
down at the corners—but never mind now.  Begone
dull care, thou canker.  Come!  I should like your
mother to know all about me.  You will tell her how
young I am looking.  You will say that I would be
sure to come tripping over to see her but for my
accident.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will tell her how I have seen you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You needn't dwell on the crutches; but she knows,
she has heard of that affliction of mine, it was the talk
of the county, thousands of tender hearts beat in
sympathy with me.  My accident is one of long standing.
I won't say when it happened.  I have not a good head
for dates, but anyhow it was not quite last year, or the
year before that.  It has told on me.  I look older than
I really am, and yet I am hearty and well.  I have such
an appetite.  Just pull me up, dear, in the chair, and
I will tell you what I eat.  I had a rasher of bacon
and a chop for breakfast, and a pewter of homebrewed
beer; that don't look like a failing digestion, does it.
And I shall eat,—Lord bless you!  You would laugh
to see me at my dinner, I eat like a ploughboy.  That
is not like the decay of old age attacking the witals, is
it, my pretty?  Now listen to me, and I will tell you
all about it.  Do you chance to notice here and there
a little grey in my hair?  Just as though a few grains
of salt had dropped among black pepper?  They come
of care, dearest, not of years.  I never had a grizzled
hair on my head till—till I struck my colours.  Now I'll
tell you all about it, and you tell your mother.  She will
pity me.  One day in my yard I stumbled over a round
of timber and fell on my back on it, and hurt my spine,
and I've been a cripple ever since.  It is a sad
pity—such a fine, strapping, manly fellow as I, in the prime
of age, to be laid by like an old condemned wessel!
Well! here I have had to lie in my window, looking
out, and not seeing much to interest me.  But the girls
of Wyvenhoe, bless their kind hearts,—they are angels
up to one and twenty—used to come to the window,
and wish me a good day, and ask after my health, and
have pleasant little gossips, and be altogether jolly.
Next, whenever they could, some one or two would
bring her knitting or needlework, and come in, and sit
here and spend an hour or so, talking, laughing and
making fun.  That was pleasant, wasn't it?  It is
wonderful what a lot those dear girls had to say for
themselves; they became quite confidential with me,
and told me all their love affairs, and how matters
stood, and who their sweethearts were.  It was worth
while being ill and laid on one's back to enjoy such
society.  Whenever I was dull and wanted some chat,
I sent my man to hoist the flag, and the next girl that
went by, "Ah!" said she, "there's that poor fellow
would like my society," and in she came and sat talking
with me as long as she was able.  Then sometimes I
had a dish of tea brought in, or some cakes, or fruit.
It was a pleasant time.  I wish it were to come over
all again.  Tell your mother all this.  I was quite the
pet of all the kind-hearted young folks in Wyvenhoe.
Now that is over.  I'll tell you about it.'  He sighed
and passed a shaking hand over his bright, twinkling
eyes.  'You must explain it all to your mother—Liddy
that was.  You see, I don't forget her name.  Now tell
me yours again; it is gone from me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'll write it down in my note-book and then I shall
remember it.  My memory is overstocked, and it takes
me a deal of time to find in it what I want.  But your
mother's name don't get buried, but lies at hand on the
top.  You'll tell her so.  Now about my troubles.  There
was one damsel, who was called Admonition; and she was
very particularly pleasant and attentive to me, and many
a little teasing and joking I had with her about her
name.  She was the girl fullest of fun, she regularly
brimmed over with it, and it ran down her sides.  She
was a milliner, and had to work for her living.  She
had no relations and no money of her own.  It is curious
what a lot of cousins she has now, mostly in the
sea-faring line, and all young.  Then she was always ready
for a chat.  She would bring her needlework and sit
with me by the hour.  I thought it vastly pleasant, and
how much more pleasant it would be if she were always
by my side to keep me laughing and chirpy.  I must
tell you that I go down some degrees when alone,—not
that my spirits fail me with age,—it is constitutional.
I was so as a boy.—Bless me! it seems to me only the
other day when I was a romping lout of a lad—I'm crisp
and crackly like seaweed in an East wind when I am in
female society, that is, female society up to one and
twenty—but I'm like the same seaweed in a Sou'wester
when I'm alone.  One day the flag was flying, but no
visitor came except Admonition.  It was the day of the
Regatta.  She said, and the tears came into her eyes,
that she was a lone girl, with no one to accompany her,
so she had come to sit with me.  She tried to cheer
up and laugh, but she felt her loneliness so that my
heart was touched, and I proposed and we were married.'  There
ensued a long pause.  Mr. Pettican looked out
of the window.  'I had a queer sort of premonitory
feeling when I said, "I take thee Admonition to my
wedded wife," but it was too late then to retract.  Now
the flag that has braved a thousand breezes is down.
It has not flown since that day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is Mrs. Pettican now?' asked Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'At the Regatta,' answered the cripple.  'You'll
tell your mother how I am situated.  She will drop a
tear for poor Charlie.  I will tell you what, Me——' he
looked at his note-book, 'Mehalah; men fancy all girls
sultana raisins, but when they bite them they get very
hard pips between their teeth.  There's a Methodist
preacher here has been haranguing on conversion, and
persuading Admonition that she is a new creature.  I
know she is.  She was converted on the day of the
marriage ceremony; but the conversion was not
something to boast of.  Matrimony with women is what
jibbing is with ships, they go through a movement
of staggering and then away they start off on a tack
clean contrary to the course they were sailing before.
Marriage, Mehalah, is like Devonshire cream; it is very
rich and tasty, but it develops a deal of bile.  Look
here, my pretty!'  In a moment he was off his chair,
stumping in his crutches round the room, dragging his
paralysed limbs after him.  He returned to his chair.
'Put up my legs, dear,' he begged; then said, 'That is
the state of my case; my better half is Admonition, the
poor paralysed, helpless, dead half is me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He did not speak for some moments, but brushed
his eyes with his feeble hand.  At last he said, 'I've
unburdened my soul.  Tell your mother.  Now go ahead,
and let me know what you want.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah told Mr. Pettican the circumstances.  She
said that her mother wanted a loan of fifteen or twenty
pounds.  If she could not procure the sum, she would
have her cow taken from her, then they would be unable
to pay the rent next Lady Day, and be without milk for
the winter.  They would be turned out of the little
farm on which her mother had lived so long, in quiet
and contentment, and this would go far to break her
mother's heart.  She told him candidly that the loan
could only be repaid in instalments.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man listened patiently, only passing his
hand in an agitated manner across his face several
times.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I wish I could help you,' he said, when she had
done; 'I have money.  I have laid by some.  There
is plenty in the box and more at the bank, but I can't
get at it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sir!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Before I struck my colours, Mehalah, I did what I
liked with my money; on market days my man went
into Colchester, and I always gave him a little sum to
lay out in presents for my kind visitors.  Bless you; a
very trifle pleased them.  It is different now.  I don't
spend a penny myself.  The money is spent for me.  I
don't keep the key of my cashbox.  Admonition has it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then,' said Mehalah, rising from her seat, 'all is
over with us.  My mother, your cousin, will in her old
age be cast destitute into the world.  But, if you really
wish to help her, be a man, use your authority, and do
what you choose with your own.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Bless me!' exclaimed Mr. Pettican touching his
brow with his trembling hand, 'I will be a man.  Am
I not a man!  If I don't exert my authority, people
will say I am in my dotage.  I—I—in my flower and
cream of my age—in the dotage!  Go, Me——' he
looked in his note-book, 'Mehalah, fetch me my cashbox,
it is in the bedroom cupboard upstairs, on the right,
over this.  Bring the box down.  Stay though!  Before
you come down just feel in my wife's old dress pocket.
She may have forgotten to take her keys with her to
the Regatta.  It is just possible.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot do that.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, no, perhaps you had better not.  Do you
happen to have a bunch of keys with you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, sir.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, never mind.  Bring me the case.  I will be
a man.  I will show the world I am not in my dotage.
I will be of the masculine gender, dative case, if it
pleases me, and Admonition may lump it if she don't
like it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah obeyed.  She found the box, which was of
iron, brought it downstairs, and placed it on the table
by Mr. Pettican.  'I've been turning the matter over
in my mind,' said he, 'and I see a very happy way out
of it without a row.  Give me the poker.  You will
find a cold chisel in that drawer.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will tell you my idea.  Whilst I am left here all
alone, burglars have broken into the house, knowing my
helpless condition, and have ransacked the place, found
my cashbox and broken it open.'  He chuckled and
rubbed his hands.  'I shall be able accurately to describe
the ruffians.  One has a black moustache, and the other
a red beard, and they look like foreigners and speak a
Dutch jargon.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He put the chisel to the lid, and struck at it with
the poker, starting the hinges by the blow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At that moment the door was flung wide, and in
swam a dashing young woman in very gay colours, on
the arm of a yachtsman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Charles!' she cried; 'what are you after?' then
turning abruptly on Mehalah, 'And pray what are you
doing here, in my house?'  Mr. Pettican's head, which
had been craned forward in eagerness over the box,
retreated amidst the collar and cravat, and almost
disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who are you?' she asked of Mehalah, with an
insulting air.  'Out of this house with you at once!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My dear Monie!' pleaded Mr. Pettican, lifting his
shaking hands into an attitude of prayer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No "My dears" and "Monies" to me,' said the
wife.  'I want to know what you are after with my
cashbox?  Ho, ho! trying to prize it open and squander
my little sums laid aside for household expenses
on—Heaven knows whom.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mr. Pettican is my mother's cousin,' said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Cousin, indeed! never heard Mr. Pettican speak of
you.  Cousins are sure to turn up when money is
wanted.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mr. Pettican,' said Mehalah, refusing to notice the
insolent woman, 'be a man and let me have the money
you promised.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I should like to be a man, oh!  I wish I were a man!
But I can't, I can't indeed, dear.  I haven't been
myself since I hauled down my flag.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Charles, hold out your hand, and invite my cousin
Timothy to dinner.  He has kindly consented to stay
a fortnight with us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Timothy!' echoed Mr. Pettican, 'I did not know
you had such a cousin.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you think you know anything of my relations?'
exclaimed Admonition; 'I should hope not, they are a
little above your sphere.  There are lots more cousins!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The poor little man sat shrinking behind his blinkers,
peering piteously now at Mehalah, and then at his wife.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Be a man,' said Mehalah, grasping him by both
hands.  'Save us from ruin.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Can't do it, Pretty, can't.  I have struck my
colours.'</span></p>
