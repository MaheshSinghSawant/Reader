<p class="pfirst"><span>The cry roused Mehalah, as a step into cold water
is a shock bringing a somnambulist instantly to full
consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In a minute she was outside the house, looking for
the person whose appeal had struck her ear.  She saw
the wooden shutter that had closed the window of the
madman's den broken, hanging by one hinge.  Two
bleached, ghostly hands were stretched through the
bars, clutching and opening.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At his door, above the steps, stood Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Hah!  Glory!' he said, 'has the crazed fool's shout
brought you down?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She was stepping towards the window.  Rebow ran
down before her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go in!' he shouted to his brother.  'Curse you,
you fool! breaking the shutter and yelling out, scaring
the whole house.'  He had a whip, a great carter's
whip in his hand, and he smacked it.  The hands
disappeared instantly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Bring me a hammer and nails,' ordered Rebow.
'You will find them in the window of the hall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah obeyed.  Rebow patched up the shutter
temporarily.  There were iron bars to the window.
The wooden cover had a small hole in it to admit a
little light.  During the summer the shutter was
removed.  It was used to exclude the winter cold.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why did he call me?' asked Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He did not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I heard his cry.  He called me thrice, Glory!
Glory!  Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He was asking for his victuals,' said Rebow, with
a laugh.  'Look you here, Glory!  I have been alone
in this house so long, and have thought of you, and
brooded on you, and had none to speak to about you.
At last I took to teaching my brother your name.  I
wouldn't give him his food till he said it.  I taught
him like a parrot.  I made him speak your name, as
you make a dog sit up and beg for a bit of bread.  I've
been about on the road all day, on account of your
perversity and wilfulness, and so forgot to give my brother
his food.  But I don't care.  He had no right to smash
the shutter and yell out the way he has.  I'll punish
him for it.  I'll lay into him with the whip, so as he
shall not forget.  He'll be quieter in future.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do not,' said Mehalah.  'It is a shame; it is
wicked to treat a poor afflicted wretch thus.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh! you are turned advocate, are you?  You take
the side of a madman against the sane.  That is like a
perverse creature such as you.  What has he done for
you, that you should try to save his back?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No mercy is to be looked for at your hands,' said
Mehalah sullenly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look you here, Glory! the moon is full, and that
always makes him madder.  I have to keep him short
of food, and strap his shoulders, or he would tear the
walls down in his fury.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me attend to him,' asked Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You'd be afraid of him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I should pity him,' said the girl.  'He and I are
both wretched, both your victims, both prisoners,
wearing your chains.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You have no chains round you, Glory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have I not?  I have, invisible, may be, but firmer,
colder, more given to rust into and rub the flesh than
those carried by that poor captive.  I have tried to
break away, but I cannot.  You draw me back.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I told you I could.  I have threads to every finger,
and I can move you as I will.  I can bring you into
my arms.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That—never,' said Mehalah gloomily and leisurely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You think not?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am sure not.  You may boast of your power
over me.  You have a power over me, but that power
has its limits.  I submit now, but only for my mother's
sake.  Were she not dependent wholly on me, were
she dead, I would defy you and be free, free as the gull
yonder.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah put his hand inside his door, drew out his
gun, and in a moment the gull was seen to fall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is not dead,' said Mehalah, with a gleam of
triumph in her sad face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, but winged.  The wretch will flutter along
disabled.  She will try to rise, and each effort will give
her mortal agony, and grind the splintered bones
together and make the blood bleed away.  She will
skim a little while above the water, but at length
will fall into the waves and be washed ashore dead.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes,' said Mehalah; 'you will not kill, but
wound—wound to the quick.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is about it, Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me repeat my request,' she said; 'allow me
to attend to your brother.  I must have someone,
some thing, to pity and minister to.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You can minister to me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'So I do.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And you can pity me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Pity you!' with scorn.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Aye.  I am to be pitied, for here am I doing all
I can to win the heart of a perverse and stubborn girl,
and I meet with nothing but contempt and hate.  I am
to be pitied.  I am a man; I love you, and am defied
and repulsed, and fled from as though I had the
pestilence, and my house were a plague hospital.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Will you let me attend to your brother?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, I will not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The shutter was dashed off its hinges, flung out
into the yard, and the two ghastly hands were again
seen strained through the bars.  Again there rang out
in the gathering night the piteous cry, 'Glory!  Glory!
Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'By God! you hound,' yelled Elijah, and he raised
his whip to bring it down in all its cutting force on the
white wrists.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot bear it.  I will not endure it!' cried
Mehalah, and she arrested the blow.  She caught the
stick and wrenched it out of the hand of Rebow before
he could recover from his surprise, and broke it over
her knee and flung it into the dyke that encircled the
yard.  There was, however, no passion in her face, she
acted deliberately, and her brown cheek remained
unflushed.  'I take his cry as an appeal to me, and I
will protect him from your brutality.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are civil,' sneered Elijah.  'What are you in
this house?  A servant, you say.  Then you should
speak and act as one.  No, Glory! you know you are
not, and cannot be, a servant.  You shall be its mistress.
I forgive you what you have done, for you are asserting
your place and authority.  Only do not cry out and
protest if in future I speak to the workmen of you as
the mistress.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A hard expression settled on Mehalah's brow and
eyes.  She turned away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Are you going?  Have you not a parting word,
mistress?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go!' she said, in a tone unlike that usual with
her.  'I care for nothing.  I feel for no one.  I am
without a heart.  Do what you will with that brother
of yours.  I am indifferent to him and to his fate.
Everything in the world is all one to me now.  If you
had let me think for the poor creature and feed him,
and attend to him, I might have become reconciled to
being here; I could at least have comforted my soul
with the thought that I was ministering to the welfare
of one unhappy wretch and lightening his lot.  But
now,' she shrugged her shoulders.  'Now everything is
all one to me.  I can laugh,' she did so, harshly.  'There
is nothing in the world that I care for now, except my
mother, and I do not know that I care very much for
her now.  I feel as if I had no heart, or that mine were
frozen in my bosom.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You do not care now for your mother!' exclaimed
Rebow.  'Then leave her here to my tender mercy, and
go out into the world and seek your fortune.  Go on
the tramp like your gipsy ancestry.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Leave my mother to your mercy!' echoed Mehalah.
'To the mercy of you, who could cut your poor crazed
brother over the fingers with a great horsewhip!  To
you, who have stung and stabbed at my self-respect
till it is stupefied; who have treated me, whom you
profess to love, as I would not treat a marsh
briar.[1]  Never.  Though my heart may be stunned or dead, yet
I have sufficient instinct to stand by and protect her
who brought me into the world and nursed me, when I
was helpless.  As for you, I do not hate you any more
than I love you.  You are nothing to me but a coarse,
ill-conditioned dog.  I will beat you off with a
hedge-stake if you approach me nearer than I choose.  If you
keep your distance and keep to yourself, you will not
occupy a corner of my thoughts.  I take my course,
you take yours.'  She walked moodily away and
regained her room.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Mrs. Sharland began at once a string of queries.
She wanted to know who had cried out and alarmed
them, what Mehalah had been saying to Rebow, whether
she had come to her senses at last, how long she was
going to sulk, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah answered her shortly and rudely; that the
cry had come from the madman, that he meant nothing
by it, he had been taught to yell thus when he wanted
food, that he had been neglected by his brother and
was distressed; as for her mother's other questions, she
passed them by without remark, and brushing in front
of the old woman, went into the inner chamber.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah!' called Mrs. Sharland.  'I will not have
you glouting in there any longer.  Come out.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl paid no attention to her.  She leaned her
head against the wall and put her hands to her ears.
Her mother's voice irritated her.  She wanted quiet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is too much of a good thing,' said the old
woman, going in after her.  'Come away, Mehalah, you
have your work to do, and it must be done.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are right,' answered the girl in a hard tone,
'I am a servant, and I will do my work.  I will go down
at once.'  She knitted her brows, and set her teeth.
Her complexion was dull and dead.  Her hair was in
disorder, and fell about her shoulders.  She twisted it
up carelessly, and tied it round her head with George's
handkerchief.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she returned, her mother was in bed, and
half-asleep.  Mehalah went to the window, the window
that looked towards the Ray, and drawing the curtains
behind her, remained there, her head sunk, but her
eyes never wavering from the point where her home
had been when she was happy, her heart free, and her
self-respect unmangled.  So passed hour after hour.
There was full moon, but the sky was covered with
clouds white as curd, scudding before a north-west wind.
The moon was dulled but hardly obscured every now and
then, and next moment glared out in naked brilliancy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Everything in the house was hushed.  Elijah had
gone to bed.  Mehalah had heard his heavy tread on
the stair, and the bang of his door as he shut it; it had
roused her, she turned her head, and her face grew
harder in the cold moonlight.  Then she looked back
towards the Ray.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her mother was asleep.  The starlings and sparrows
who had worked their way under the eaves, and were
building nests between the ceiling and the tiles, stirred
uneasily; they were cold and hungry and could not
sleep.  Anyone not knowing what stirred would have
supposed that mice were holding revel in the attics.
There yonder on the marsh was something very white,
like paper, flapping and flashing in the moonlight.
What could it be?  It moved a little way, then blew
up and fell and flapped again.  Was it a sheet of
paper?  If so how came it not to be swept away by the
rushing wind.  No, it was no sheet of paper.  Mehalah's
curiosity was roused.  She opened the window and
looked out.  At the same moment it rose, fluttered
nearer, eddied up, and fell again.  A cloud drifted over
the moon and made the marsh grey, and in the shadow
the restless object was lost, the flash of white was blotted
over.  When the moon gleamed out again, she saw it
once more.  It did not move.  The wind tore by, and shook
the casement in her hand, but did not lift and blow
away that white object.  Then there was a lull.  The
air was still for a moment.  At that moment the white
object moved again, rose once more and fluttered up, it
was flying, it was nearing,—it fell on the roof of the
bakehouse under the window.  Now Mehalah saw what
this was.  It was the wounded gull, the bird Rebow had
shot.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The miserable creature was struggling with a broken
wing, and with distilling blood, to escape to sea, to die,
and drop into the dark, tossing, foaming waves, to lose
itself in infinity.  It could not expire on the land, it
must seek its native element, the untamed, unconfined
sea; it could not give forth its soul on the trampled,
reclaimed, hedged-in earth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Was it not so with Glory?  Could her free soul rest
where she now was?  Could it endure for ever this
tyranny of confinement within impalpable walls?  She
who had lived, free as a bird, to be blown here and
there by every impulse, when every impulse was fresh
and pure as the unpolluted breath of God that rushes
over the ocean.  Was she not wounded by the same
hand that had brought down the white mew?  There
she was fluttering, rising a little, again falling, her
heart dim with tears, her life's vigour bleeding away,
the white of her bosom smeared with soil that adhered,
as she draggled in the mire, into which he had cast her.
Whither was she tending?  She turned her face out to
sea—it lay stretched before her ink-black.  Red Hall
and its marshes were to her a prison, and freedom was
beyond its sea-wall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She was startled by a sound as of bricks falling.
She listened without curiosity.  The sound recurred
again, and was followed after a while by a grating noise,
and then a rattle as of iron thrown down.  She heard
nothing further for a few minutes, and sank back into
her dull dream, and watching of the poor mew, that
now beat its wings on the roof, and then slid off and
disappeared.  Was it dead now?  It did not matter.
Mehalah could not care greatly for a bird.  But
presently from out of the shadow of the bakehouse floated
a few white feathers.  The gull was still wending its
way on, with unerring instinct, towards the rolling sea.
Just then Mehalah heard a thud, as though some heavy
body had fallen, accompanied by a short clank of metal.
She would have paid it no further attention had she not
been roused by seeing the madman striding and then
jumping, with the chain wound round one arm.  He
looked up at the moon, his matted hair was over his
face, and Mehalah could not distinguish the features.
He ran across the yard, and then leaped the dyke and
went off at long bounds, like a kangaroo, over the
pasture towards the sea-wall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah drew back.  What should she do?  Should
she rouse Elijah, and tell him that his brother had
wrenched off the grating of his window and worked his
way out, and was now at large in the glare of moon on
the marshes, leaping and rejoicing in his freedom?  No,
she would not.  Let the poor creature taste of liberty,
inhale the fresh, pure air, caper and race about under
no canopy but that of God's making.  She would not
curtail his time of freedom by an hour.  He would
suffer severely for his evasion on the morrow, when
Elijah would call out his men, and they would hunt the
poor wretch down like a wild beast.  She could see
Rebow stand over him with his great dog-whip, and
strike him without mercy.  She rouse Rebow!  She
reconsign the maniac to his dark dungeon, with its
dank floor and stifling atmosphere!  The gull was
forgotten now; its little strivings overlooked in anxiety
for the mightier strivings of the human sufferer.  Yet all
these three were bound together by a common tie!
Each was straining for the infinite, and for escape from
thraldom; one with a broken wing, one with a broken
brain, one with a broken heart.  There was the wounded
bird flapping and edging its way outwards to the salt
sea.  There was the dazed brain driving the wretched
man in mad gambols along the wall to the open water.
There was the bruised soul of the miserable girl
yearning for something, she knew not what, wide, deep,
eternal, unlimited, as the all-embracing ocean.  In
that the bird, the man, the maid sought freedom, rest,
recovery.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She could not go to bed and leave the poor maniac
thus wandering unwatched.  She would go out and
follow him, and see that no harm came to him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She took off her shoes, shut the window.  Her
mother was sleeping soundly.  She undid the door and
descended the stairs.  They creaked beneath her steps,
but Rebow, who had slept through the noise made by
his brother in effecting his escape, was not awakened
by her footfall.  She unlocked the back door, closed it,
and stole forth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As she passed the bakehouse she lit on the wounded
bird.  In a spasm of sympathy she bent and took it up.
It made a frantic effort to escape, and uttered its wild,
harsh screams; but she folded her hands over the wings
and held the bird to her bosom and went on.  The
blood from the broken bone and torn flesh wet her
hand, and dried on it like glue.  She heeded it not,
but walked forward.  By the raw moonlight she saw
the madman on the wall.  He had thrown down his
chain.  He heeded it not now.  There had been sufficient
intelligence or cunning in his brain to bid him
deaden its clanking when making his escape from the
house.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He sprang into the air and waved his arms; his
wild hair blew about in the wind, it looked like seaweed
tangles.  Then he sat down.  Mehalah did not venture
on the wall, but crept along in the marsh.  He had got
a stone, and was beating at his chain with it upon the
stone casing of the wall on the sea face.  He worked at
it patiently for an hour, and at last broke one of the
links.  He waved the chain above his head with a shout,
and flung it behind him into the marsh.  He ran on.
Mehalah stole after him.  He never looked back, always
forwards or upwards.  Sometimes he danced and shouted
and sang snatches to the moon when it flared out from
behind a cloud.  Once, when at a bend of the wall, his
shadow was cast before him, he cowered back from it,
jabbering, and putting his hands supplicatingly towards
it; then he slipped down the bank, laughed, and ran
across the marsh, with his shadow behind him, and
thought in his bewildered brain that he had cunningly
eluded and escaped the figure that stood before him to
stop him.  He reached the mill that worked the pump.
He must have remembered it: it was mixed up somehow
with the confused recollections in his brain, for it
did not seem to startle or frighten him.  He scarcely
noticed it, but, uttering a howl, a wild, triumphant
shout, sprang upon a duck punt hauled up on the wall.
It was Elijah's punt, left there occasionally, quite as
often as at the landing near the house, a small,
flat-bottomed boat, painted white, with a pair of white,
muffled oars in it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In a moment, before Mehalah had considered what
to do, or whether she could do anything, he had run
the punt down into the water, and had seated himself
in it, and taken the oars and struck out to sea, out
towards the open, towards the unbounded horizon.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He rowed a little way, not very far, and then stood
up.  He could not apparently endure to face the land,
the place of long confinement, he must turn and look
out to sea.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah stood on the sea-wall.  The waves were
lapping at her feet.  The tide had turned.  It flowed
at midnight, and midnight was just past.  She had
forgotten the gull she bore, in her alarm for the man,
she opened her arms, and the bird fluttered down and
fell into the water.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The moon was now swimming in a clear space of
sky free of cloudfloes.  In that great light the man was
distinctly visible, standing, waving his arms in the
white punt, drifting, not rapidly, but steadily outwards.
In that great light went out also, on the same cold,
dark water, the dying bird, that now stirred not a
wing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah watched motionless, with a yearning in
her heart that she could not understand, her arms
extended towards that boundless expanse towards which
the man and the bird were being borne, and into which
they were fading.  He was singing!  Some old, childish
lay of days that were happy, before the shadow fell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There stood Glory, looking, indistinctly longing,
till her eyes were filled with tears.  She looked on
through the watery vail, but saw nothing.  When she
wiped it away she saw nothing.  She watched till the
day broke, but she saw nothing more.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Mrs. De Witt was not happy, taken all in all.  There
were moments indeed of conviviality when she boasted
that she was now what she had always wanted to be,
independent, and with none to care for but herself,
'none of them bullet-headed, shark-bellied men to fuss
and worrit about.'  But she laboured, like the moon,
under the doom of passing through phases, and one of
these was dark and despondent.  As she lay in her
bunk of a raw morning, and contemplated her toes in
the grey light that fell through the hatches, she was
forced to admit that her financial position was not
established on a secure basis.  It reposed on smelt,
shrimps, dabs and eels, a fluctuating, an uncertain
foundation.  She strode about the island and the
nearest villages on the mainland, with a basket on her
arm, containing a half-pint measure, and a load of
shrimps, or swung a stick in her hand from which
depended slimy eels.  She did a small trade at the
farm-houses, and reaped some small retail profits.
The farmers' wives were accustomed to see her in
sunshine habited in scarlet more or less mottled with
crimson, in storm wearing a long grey military great
coat.  In summer a flapping straw hat adorned her
head; in winter a fur cap with a great knob at the top,
and fur lappets over her ears.  In compliment to her
condition of mourner a big black bow was sewn to the
summit of the knob, and she looked like a knight
helmeted, bearing as crest a butterfly displayed, sable.
It was seldom that she was dismissed from a farmhouse
without having disposed of a few shrimps, or some
little fish; for if she were not given custom regularly,
she took huff and would not call with her basket again,
till an apology were offered, and she was entreated to
return.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The profits of the trade were not however
considerable, and such as they were underwent reduction
on all her rounds.  She consumed the major part of
them in her orbit at the 'Fountain,' the 'Fox,' the
'Leather Bottle' or the 'Dog and Pheasant.'  In the
bar of each of these ancient taverns, Mrs. De Witt was
expected and greeted as cordially as at the
farm-kitchen.  There she was wont to uncasque, and ruffle
out her white cap, and turn out her pockets to count
her brass.  There also this brass underwent
considerable diminution.  The consumption of her profits
generally left Mrs. De Witt in a condition rather the
worse than the better.  She was a sinking fund that
sucked in her capital.  However cheery of face, and
crisp of gathers, Mrs. De Witt may have started on
her mercantile round, the close saw her thick of speech,
leery of eye, festoony of walk, vague in her calculations,
reckless of measurement with her little pewter
half-pint, and generally crumpled in cap and garment.  If
she were still able to rattle a few coppers in her pocket
when she stumbled up the ladder, toppled down into
the hold, and tumbled into her bunk, she was happy.
She was her own mistress, she had no helpless, foolish
man, husband or son, to consider, and before whom to
veil her indiscretions; she pulled up the ladder as soon
as she was home; and, as she said, sat up for no one
but herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She had not quite reconciled her smoking to her
conscience, when she had a son to set a model of life
to, before whom to posture as the ideal of womanhood
and maternity; then when his foot was heard on the
ladder she would slip her clay into the oven, and
murmur something about a pinch out of her snuff-box
having fallen on the stove, or about her having smoked
her best gown as a preventive to moth.  Now she
smoked with composure, and turned over in her mind
the various possibilities that lay before her.  Should
she bow to the hard necessity of leading about a tame
man again, or should she remain in her present
condition of absolute freedom?  The five-and-twenty pounds
had nearly disappeared, and she was not certain that
she could live in comfort on her gains by the trade in
shrimps and eels.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt was a moralist, and when nearly
drunk religious.  She was not a church-goer, but she
was fond of convivial piety.  Over her cups she had a
great deal to say of her neighbours' moral shortcomings
and of her own religious emotions.  When in a state
of liquor she was always satisfied that she was in a state
of grace.  In her sober hours she thought of nothing
save how to make both ends meet.  She mused on her
future, and hovered in her choice, she feared that
sooner or later she must make her election, to take a
man or to do without one.  The eagle can gaze on the
sun without blinking, but Mrs. De Witt could not fix
her eye on matrimony without the water coming into
it.  That was a step she would not take till driven to
it by desperation.  The </span><em class="italics">Pandora's</em><span> bottom was not all
that could be wished, it was rotten.  Mrs. De Witt saw
that the repair of the </span><em class="italics">Pandora</em><span> was a matter she could
not compass.  When she let in water, Mrs. De Witt
would admit a husband.  Whilst a plank remained
impervious to the tide, so would her breast to
matrimonial dreams.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The spring tides came, and with them seawater
oozing in at the rotted joints of the vessel.  Mrs. De
Witt was well aware of the presence of bilgewater in
the bottom.  Bilgewater has the faculty of insisting on
cognisance being taken of its presence.  Whenever
she returned to the </span><em class="italics">Pandora</em><span>, the odour affected her
with horror, for it assured her that her days of
independence were numbered.  But all at once a new light
sprang up in the old lady's mind, she saw a middle
course open to her; a way of maintaining a partial
independence, on a certainty of subsistence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She had not returned the call made her by her
nephew Elijah Rebow.  Half a year had elapsed, but
that was no matter.  Etiquette of high life does not
rule the grades to which the Rebows and De Witts
belonged.  Why should not she keep house for her
nephew?  He was well off, and he was little at home;
his house was large, she would have free scope in it for
carrying on her own independent mode of life, and her
keep would cost her nothing.  That house had been
her home.  In it she had been born and nurtured.
She had only left it to be incumbered with a husband
and a son.  Now she was free from these burdens,
what more reasonable than that she should return?  It
was the natural asylum to which she must flee in her
necessity.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was true indeed that Rebow had taken in Mrs. Sharland
and Glory, but what ties attached them to
him equal to hers of flesh and blood.  Was she not his
aunt?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now that Mrs. De Witt saw that it was clearly in
her interest to disestablish the Sharlands and install
herself in their place, she saw also, with equal clearness,
that morality and religion impelled her to take this
course.  What was Elijah's connection with Glory?
Was it not a public scandal, the talk of the neighbourhood?
As aunt of Rebow was she not in duty bound to
interfere, to act a John the Baptist in that Herod's
court, and condemn the intimacy as improper?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt pulled herself up, morally as well
as physically, and in habit also.  That is, she was
sitting on her military coat tails, and with a gathering
sense of her apostleship of purity she shook them out,
she drew in at the same time the strings of her apron
and of her cap, tightened and lifted her bustle, so that
the red military tails cocked in an audacious and
defiant—if not in an apostolic and missionary manner.
She ran her fingers through the flutings of her frills, to
make them stand out and form a halo round her face,
like the corolla of white round the golden centre of the
daisy.  Then she drank off a noggin of gin to give
herself courage, and away she started, up the
companion, over the deck, and down the ladder, to row to
Red Hall with her purpose hot in her heart.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After the disappearance of the madman, Mehalah
had returned to the house and to her room.  She said
nothing next day of what she had seen.  Elijah and his
men had searched the marshes and found no trace of
the man save the broken chain.  That Rebow took
back, and hung over his chimney-piece.  He enquired
in Salcott and Virley, but no one there had seen
anything of the unfortunate creature.  It was obvious that
he had not gone inland.  He had run outward, and
when it was found that the punt was gone, the
conclusion arrived at was that the madman had left the
marshes in it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah rowed to Mersea, and made enquiries without
eliciting any information.  He went next to Bradwell
on the south coast of the great Black water estuary,
there his punt had been found, washed ashore; but no
traces of the man were to be discovered.  That he was
drowned admitted of no doubt.  Rebow satisfied himself
that this was the case, and was content to be thus
rid of an encumbrance.  Mehalah's knowledge of the
matter was unsuspected, and she was therefore not
questioned.  She did not feel any necessity for her to
mention what she had seen.  It could be of no possible
advantage to anybody.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her life became monotonous, but the monotone was
one of gloom.  She had lost every interest; she
attended to her mother without heart; and omitted those
little acts of tenderness which had been customary with
her, or performed them, when her mother fretted at
the omission, in a cold, perfunctory manner.
Mrs. Sharland had been accustomed to be overruled by her
daughter, but now Mehalah neither listened to nor
combated her recommendations.  She rarely spoke,
but went through the routine of her work in a
mechanical manner.  Sometimes she spoke to her mother in a
hard, sharp tone the old woman was unused to, and
resented; but Mehalah ignored her resentment.  She
cared neither for her mother's love nor for her
displeasure.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she met the men about the farm, if they
addressed her, she repelled them with rudeness, and if
obliged to be present with them for some time, did not
speak.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Neither had she a word for Rebow.  She answered
his questions with monosyllables, or not at all, and he
had often to repeat them before she condescended to
answer.  He spoke at meal times, and attempted to
draw her into conversation, but she either did not
listen to him, was occupied with her own thoughts, or
she would not appear to hear and be interested in what
he said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A morose expression clouded and disfigured her
countenance, once so frank and genial.  Joe remarked
to Jim that she was growing like the master.  Jim
replied that folks who lived together mostly did
resemble one another.  He knew a collier who had a
favourite bull-dog, and they were as alike in face as
if they were twins.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah avoided Abraham, she rarely spoke to him,
and when he attempted to open a conversation with her
she withdrew abruptly.  When all her work was done,
she walked along the sea-wall to the spit of land, and,
seating herself there, remained silent, brooding, with
dull, heavy eyes looking out to sea at the passing sails,
or the foaming waves.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not think, she sat sunk in a dull torpor.
She neither hoped anything nor recalled anything.  As
she had said to Elijah, she neither loved nor hated; she
did not fear him or desire him.  She disliked to be in
his presence, but she would not fix her mind on him,
and concern herself about him.  Her self-respect was
sick, and till that was recovered nothing could interest
and revive her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah was seated under the windmill when Mrs. De
Witt drew to land.  That lady was on her war-path,
and on seeing the person whom she designed to attack
and rout out of her shelter, she turned the beak of her
boat directly upon her, and thrust ashore at Mehalah's
feet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The sight of Mrs. De Witt in her red coat roused
the girl from her dream, and she rose wearily to her
feet and turned to walk away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory!' shouted the fishwife after her.  'Sackalive!
I want to speak to you.  Stop at once.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah paid no attention to the call, but walked
on.  Mrs. De Witt was incensed, and, after anchoring
her boat, rushed after and overtook her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'By Cock!' exclaimed the lady, 'here's manners!
Didn't you hear me hollering to you to hold hard and
heave to?'  She laid her hand on Mehalah's shoulder.
The girl shook it off.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sackalive!' cried Mrs. De Witt.  'We are out of
temper to-day.  We have the meagrims.  What is all
this about?  But I suppose you can't fare to look an
honest woman in the face.  The wicious eye will drop
before the stare of wirtue!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What have you to say to me?' asked Mehalah moodily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, I want to speak along of you about what
concerns you most of all.  Now his father and his
mother are dead, who's to look after Elijah's morals but
me, his aunt?  Now I can't stand these goings on,
Glory!  Here are you living in this out-of-the way
house with my nephew, who is not a married man, and
folks talk.  My family was always respectable, we kept
ourselves up in the world.  My husband's family I
know nothing about.  He was a low chap, and rose out
of the mud, like the winkles.  I took him up, and then
I dropped him again; I was large and generous of heart
when I was young—younger than I am now.  I wouldn't
do it again, it don't pay.  The man will raise the
woman, but the woman can't lift the man.  He grovels
in the mud he came out of.  She may pick him out
and wipe him clean a score of times, but when she ain't
looking, in he flops again.  I have had my experience.
Moses was a good-looking man, but he looked better
raw than cooked, he ate tougher than he cut.  He
wasn't the husband that he seemed to promise as a
bachelor.  George was another; but he was an advance
on Moses, he had a little of me in him.  There was
Rebow mixed with De Witt; he was a glass of half and
half, rum and water.  But this is neither here nor
there.  We are not talking of my family, but of you.
I'm here for my nephew's welfare and for yours.
Glory! you ain't in Red Hall for any good.  Do you think my
nephew can take in an old woman that is not worth
sixpence to bait lines with, and feed her and find her
in liquor for nothing!  Everybody knows he's after you.
He's been after you ever so long.  Everybody knows
that.  He had a hankering after you when George was
a galliwanting on the Ray.  That's known to all the
world.  Well, you can't live in the house with him and
folks not talk.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you dare to believe——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory!  I always make a point to believe the worst.
I'm a religious person, and them as sets up to be
religious always does that.  It is part of their profession.
When I buy fish of the men, I say at once, it stinks, I
know it ain't fresh! when I take shrimps I say, they're
a week out of the water, and they won't peel nicely.
So I look upon you and everyone else, and then it's a
wery pleasing surprise when I find that the stale fish
turns out fresh.  But it ain't often that happens.  It
may happen now and then, just as now and then a whale
is washed up on Mersea Island.  Now look you here,
Glory! don't you believe that Elijah will marry you
and make an honest woman of you.  He won't do it.
He don't think to do it.  He never did intend it.  He
belongs to a better family than yours.  You have gipsy
blood in your veins, and he knows it; that's as bad as
having king's evil or cancer.  I made a mistake and
looked below me.  He won't do it.  He knows that I
made a mistake, he won't do the same.  There's as
much difference in human flesh as there is in that of
flat-fish, some is that of soles, other is that of dabs;
some is fresh and firm as that of small eels, other is
coarse and greasy as that of conger.  The Rebows belong
to another lot from you altogether.  Elijah knows it.
He never thought to marry you.  He couldn't do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah, stung even through the hard panoply of
callousness in which she had encased herself, turned
surlily on the woman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You lie!  It is I who will not marry him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There's an Adam and Eve in every brown shrimp,'[1]
said Mrs. De Witt sententiously; 'and there's wigour
and weakness in every human creature.  It is possible
that at a time when Eve is up in Elijah he may have
proposed such a foolish thing as to marry you, and it is
possible that, at a time when Adam was the master in
you, you may have refused him.  I don't deny it.  But
I do say that Elijah will never marry you in cold blood.
And I'll tell you what—you won't stand out against
him for long.  He has too much of the Adam, and you
too little for that.  You may set up your pride and
self-will against him, but you will give way in the
end—your weakness will yield to his strongheadedness.
What he purposes he will carry out; you cannot oppose
Elijah; the Adam in his heart is too old and wigorous
and heady.'</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">

<p class="noindent pfirst"><span class="small">[1] Children find in the front paddles of the brown shrimp, when

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Mehalah made no answer.  Sunk in her dark
thoughts she strode on, her arms folded over her heart,
to still and crush it; her head bowed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now Glory!' pursued Mrs. De Witt; 'I've a bit
of a liking for you, after all, and I'm sorry for what I
was forced to do about that five and twenty pounds.  I
tell you, I am sorry, but I couldn't help it.  I couldn't
starve, you know—I was a lone widow without a son to
help me.  As I said, I've a sort of a liking for you, for
you was the girl my George——'  Mehalah's breast
heaved, she uttered an ill-suppressed cry, and then
covered her face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My poor George,' went on the old woman, aware
that she had gained an advantage.  'He was wery fond
of you.  Sackalive! how he would love to talk of you
to me his doting old mother, and scheme how you was
to live in love together!  That boy's heart was full of
you, full as——' she cast about for a simile, 'as a
March sprat is full of oil.  Now I know, my George—he
was a good lad! and more like me in features than
his father, but he hadn't the soul of a Rebow!—My
George, I feel sure, couldn't rest in his grave, if he'd
got one, knowing as how tongues were going about you,
and hearing what wicked things was said of your
character.  A woman's good name is like new milk.
If it once gets turned there's no sweetening it after, and
I can tell you what, Glory! your name is not as fresh
as it was; look to it before it is quite curdled and sour.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can do nothing!  I can do nothing!' moaned the
despairing girl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look you here, Glory!' said Mrs. De Witt.  'I'm
the aunt of the party, and I must attend to his morals.
I'll go in and see him and I'll manage matters.  He's
my nephew.  I can do anything with him.  Trust me
with men, girl.  I know 'em.  They are like nettles.
Grasp 'em and they are harmless; touch 'em trembling,
and they sting you.  They are like eels, try to hold
them where you will and they wriggle away, but run a
skewer through their gills and you have them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What are you here for, talking to my girl?' asked
Rebow, suddenly coming from behind the house, which
Mrs. De Witt had now reached.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sackalive!' exclaimed his aunt, 'how you flustered
me.  We was just talking of you when you appeared.
It is wonderful how true proverbs are; they are the
Bible of those that don't read, a sort of scripture written
in the air.  But I want a talk along of you, Elijah, that
is what I'm come after, I your precious aunt, who loves
you as the oyster loves his shell, and the crab its young
that it cuddles.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you want with me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come, Elijah, let us go indoors.  To tell you
Gospel truth, I'm dry after my row and want a wet.
As I wet I will talk.  I've that to say to you that
concerns you greatly.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Follow me,' he said surlily, and led the way up the
steps.  Mehalah turned back, but walked not to the
point where she had been sitting before, lest she should
be again disturbed on the return of Mrs. De Witt to her
boat.  She went instead to the gate at the bridge over
the dyke, that led towards Salcott.  There was no real
road, only a track through the pasture land.  She
leaned her hands on the bar of the gate and laid her
weary head on her hands.  Outside the gate was a
tillage field with green wheat in it glancing in the
early summer air.  Aloft the larks were spiring and
caroling.  In the ploughed soil of Mehalah's heart
nothing had sprung up,—above it no glad thought soared
and sang.  Her head was paralysed and her heart was
numb.  The frost lay there, and the clods were as iron.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the meantime Mrs. De Witt was in the hall with
her nephew, endeavouring to melt him into geniality,
but he remained morose and unimpressionable.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>By slow approaches she drew towards the object of
her visit.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have been very troubled, nephew, by the gossip
that goes about.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you?' asked he, 'I thought you were
impervious to trouble short of loss of grog.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You know, Elijah, that your character is precious
to me.  I wally it, for the honour of the family.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What are you driving at?' he asked with an oath.
'Speak out, and then take your slimy tongue off my
premises.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is my old home, Elijah, the dear old place
where I spent so many happy and innocent days.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, you are not likely to spend any more of either
sort here now.  Say what you have to say, and begone.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You fluster me, Elijah.  When I have a glass of
rare good stuff such as this, I like to sit over it, and
talk, and sip, and relax.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't,' he said; 'I gulp it down and am off.  Come,
say your say, and be quick about it.  I have my affairs
to attend to and can't sit here palavering with an old
woman.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh!' exclaimed Mrs. De Witt, in rising wrath, 'if
I were young it would be different, if I were not a moral
and religious character it would be different, if I were
not a Rebow, but half gipsy, half boor, it would be
different!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you allude to Glory, with that sneer,' said he, 'I
tell you, it would be different.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I dare say!' exclaimed Mrs. De Witt tossing her
head.  'Blood and kinship are all forgot.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You forgot them fast enough when you ran after
Moses De Witt.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I did demean myself, I admit,' said she; 'but I
have repented it since in dabs and sprats, and I don't
intend to do it again.  Listen to me, Elijah.  Once for
all, I want to know what you mean by keeping this girl
Glory here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You do, do you?—So do I.  I wonder; she defies
and hates me, yet I keep her.  I keep her here, I can
do no other.  I would to God I could shake free of her
and forget her, forget that I had ever seen her, but I
can't do it.  She and I are ordained for one another.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Parcel of stuff!' exclaimed his aunt.  'You send
her packing, her and her old fool of a mother, and I
will come and keep house for you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Pack Glory off!' echoed Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, break this wretched, degrading tie.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I couldn't do it!' he said.  'I tell you again, I
would if I could.  I know as well as if it were written
in flames on the sky that no good can come of her being
here, but for better for worse, for well or for woe, here
we two are, and here we remain.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You love her??</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I love her and I hate her.  I love her with every
fibre and vein, and bone and nerve, but I hate her too,
with my soul, because she does not love me, but hates
me.  I could take her to my heart and keep her there,'
his breast heaved and his dark eyes flared, 'and kiss her
on her mouth and squeeze the breath out of her, and
cast her dead at my feet.  Then perhaps I might be
happy.  I am now in hell; but were she not here, were
I alone, and she elsewhere, it would be hell unendurable
in its agonies, I should go mad like my brother.  She
must be mine, or my fate is the same as his.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Are you going to marry her?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She will not marry me.  Believe what I say.  That
girl, Glory, is the curse and ruin of me and of this house.
I know it, and yet I cannot help it.  She might have
made me happy and built up my prosperity and family.
Then I should have been a good and a glad man, a man
altogether other from what I am now.  But your son
came in the way.  He marred everything.  Glory still
thinks of him, it does not matter that he be gone.  She
will cling to him and keep from me.  Yet she is
destined for me.  She never was for George.  If he were
to turn up—I don't say that it is possible or even
probable, but suppose he were—she would fly to him.  I
might chain her up, but she'd break away.  There is
nothing for it,' he pursued, drooping into a sullen mood.
'We must battle it out between us.  None can or must
intervene; whoever attempts it shall be trampled under
our feet.  We must work out our own fate together;
there is no help for it.  I tell you, if I were born again,
and I knew that this were before me, I'd fly to the
Indies, to Africa, anywhere to be from her, so as never
to see her, never to know of her, and then I might jog
on through life in quiet, and some sort of happiness.
But that is not possible.  I have seen her.  I have her
here under my roof, but we are still apart as the poles.
Go away, aunt, it is of no good your interfering.  No
one comes here, she and I must work the sum out
between us.  There's a fate over all and we cannot fight
against it, but it falls on us and crushes us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt was awed.  She rose.  She knew that
her mission was fruitless, that there was no possibility
of her gaining her point.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She opened the door, and started back before an
apparition in carnation and white.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Whom have we here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mrs. Charles Pettican, madam,' said the apparition
with a stately curtsey.</span></p>
