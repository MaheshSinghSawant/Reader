<p class="pfirst"><span>It was Christmas Eve.  A hard frost had set in.  The
leaves which had hung on the thorn trees on the Ray
rained off and were whirled away by the wind and
scattered over the rising and falling waters in the Rhyn.
On the saltings were many pools, filled from below,
through crab burrows, from the channels; when the
tide mounted, the water squirted up through these
passages and brimmed the pools, and when the tide fell,
it was sucked down through them as if running out of
a colander.  Now a thin film of ice was formed about
the edges of these pondlets, and the marsh herbs that
dipped in them were encased in crystal.  The wild
geese and ducks came in multitudes, and dappled the
water of Mersea channel.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There's four gone,' said Abraham Dowsing in a
sulky voice to Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Four what?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Four ewes to be sure, of what else have we more
than one?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where are they?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is what I should like to know.  Two went
yesterday, but I said nothing about it, as I thought they
might be found, or that I hadn't counted aright; but
there's two more missing to-day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What can have become of them?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It's no use asking me.  Is it like I should know?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But this is most extraordinary.  They must have
wandered off the saltings, on to the causeway, and so
away.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is likely, ain't it,' said Abraham.  'It is like
the ways of sheep, to scatter, and two or three to go off
and away from all the flock.  I'll believe that when
sheep change their nature.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They must have fallen into a pool and been drowned.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then I should find their carcases; but I haven't.
Perhaps there has been a spring tide at the wrong time
of the year and overflowed and drowned them.  That's
likely, isn't it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But, Abraham, they must be found.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then you must find 'em yourself.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where can they be?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I've told you it is no use asking me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Can they have been stolen?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I reckon that is just about it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Stolen!' exclaimed Mehalah, her blood flashing to
her face and darkening cheek and brow.  'Do you mean
to tell me that some scoundrel has been here in the
night, and carried off four of our ewes?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Abraham shrugged his shoulders; 'Mud tells tales
at times.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah trembled with anger.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Some boat was here last night, and night afore, and
the keel marks remain.  I saw them, and I saw
footprints of sheep too, near them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'When?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The tide is up, and you can't see.  Near the Burnt
Hill.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Abraham, this is not to be borne.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who is to help it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will.  I will watch,' she stamped her foot fiercely
on the red glasswort; 'I will kill the cowardly sneaking
thief who comes here to rob the widow and the orphan.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You must see him first,' said Abraham, 'and
sheep-stealers don't generally let themselves be seen.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A man who steals sheep can be hung for it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'll catch him,' she laughed, 'and the gallows will
be set up on the Burnt Hill, and then he shall dangle
till his bones drop away into the ooze.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You must catch him first,' said the shepherd, and
shrugged his shoulders again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah strode up and down in the marsh, her
brows knit, and the veins swollen on her temples.  She
breathed fast and her blood sang in her ears.  To be
robbed in this cowardly manner!  The thought was
maddening.  Hitherto she and her mother had deemed
themselves perfectly safe on the Ray: nothing had ever
been taken from them; the ooze and the sea water
walled them in.  The Ray was a trap from which there
was no escape save by boat.  It was said that once a
deserter found his way into Mersea Isle and lingered
about the marshes for many days.  He dared not return
by the causeway, thinking it would be watched and he
would be secured, and he had no money wherewith to
bribe a boatman to put him across elsewhere.  One
evening he lit on a farmer with a spade over his
shoulder going to the sea-wall to block a rent against
an expected tide.  He fell on the man from behind,
wrenched away his spade and cut his head open with it,
then turned out his pockets in search of coin, but found
none.  The man was taken.  He could not escape, and
was hung on the marshes where the murder was done,
by the mouth of the Pyefleet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If Mersea was a trap, how much more so the Ray.
The Sharlands had not even a lock to their door.  No
one was ever seen on the island after dark save those
who dwelt there, for the hill was surrounded on all
sides, save where girt by the sea, by a labyrinth of
creeks and pools.  A robber there would be like a fly
in a cobweb, to be caught at once.  The sheep were
allowed to ramble all over the marsh and saltings, they
could thread their way; and it was only when the
moon was full or new, and the wind in the south-east,
that the shepherd drove them into fold till the waters
subsided.  There were times—such as the coincidence
of a peculiar wind with an equinoctial tide—when to
leave the sheep on the marsh would be to ensure their
being drowned.  This was so well known, that precaution
was always taken against the occasion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The sense of being treated unjustly, of being cruelly
wronged, of advantage being taken of their feebleness,
filled Mehalah's heart with bitterness, with rage.  An
over-mastering desire for revenge came upon her.  She,
a girl, would defend her property, and chastise the man
who injured her.  She gave up all thought of obtaining
the assistance of Abraham, if it ever entered her mind.
The old man was too slow in his movements, and dull
of sight and hearing, to be of use.  As likely as not,
moreover, he would refuse to risk himself on the
saltings at night, to expose himself to the ague damp
or the bullet.  What could he, a feeble old loon, do
against a sturdy sheep-stealer?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Whom do you suspect?' asked Glory abruptly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He drew up his shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come, tell me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'An empty belly.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Abraham! one man cannot have taken four sheep
for himself.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Another shrug.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was nothing to be got out of the dogged rustic.
Mehalah waited till evening, then she wrapped a cloak
round her, put her pistol in her belt, and walked through
the marsh to the point indicated by the shepherd as the
Burnt Hill.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Through all the low flat coast land of this region,
above the saltings, or pasture overflowed by high tides
occasionally, are scattered at irregular intervals large
broad circular mounds of clay burned to brick red,
interspersed with particles of charcoal.  A few fragments
of bone are found in them, relics of the meals of those
who raised these heaps, but they cover no urns, and
enclose no cists, they contain no skeletons.  They were
never intended as funeral monuments, and are quite
different from the hoes or barrows which stand on high
land, and which were burial mounds.  The burnt or red
hills are always situate at high-water mark; near them,
below the surface of the vegetable deposit, are multitudes
of oyster shells.  Near them also are sometimes found,
sunk in the marsh, polished chert weapons.  Who raised
these mounds?  For what purpose were they reared?
These are questions that cannot be answered satisfactorily.
One thing is certain.  An immense amount of
wood must have been consumed to burn such a mass of
clay, and the country must then have been more
overgrown with timber than at present.  Many of the
mounds are now enclosed in fields by sea-walls which
hold out the tide, the plough has been drawn over them,
and the spade has scattered them over the surface,
colouring a whole field brick red, and making it rich
for the production of corn.  There is no better manure
than a red hill.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But why were these mounds so laboriously raised?
The tradition of the marsh-dwellers is that they were
platforms for huts, the earth burned as a prevention to
ague.  It is curious that in the marshy regions of
Central Africa the natives adopt a precisely similar
method for their protection from miasma.  But why
men dwelt in such numbers on the saltings remains
undetermined.  Whether they lived there to burn the
glasswort for nitre, or to steam the sea water for salt,
or to take charge of oyster grounds, is uncertain.
Fragments, very broken, of pottery are found in these
heaps, scattered throughout them, but not a specimen
of a perfect vessel.  The burnt hills are built up on the
old shingle of the shore, with no intervening line of
vegetable matter, the growth of the marsh has been
later and has risen about their bases and has partly
buried them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Glory reached the Burnt Hill, and stood on it.  A
cold east wind wailed over the waste; a white fog like
curd lay on the water, and the surface of the saltings,
clinging to the surface and rising scarce above three feet
from it.  Here and there it lifted itself in a vaporous
column, and moved along in the wind like a white spectral
woman, nodding her head and waving her arms cumbered
with wet drapery.  Above, the sky was clear, and
a fine crescent moon sparkled in it without quenching
the keenness of the stars.  Cassiopeia was glorious in
her chair, Orion burned sideways over Mersea Isle.
No red gleam was visible to-night from the tavern
window at the City, the veil of fog hung over it and
curtained it off.  To the north-west was a silvery glow
at the horizon, then there rose a pure ray as of
returning daylight, it was answered by a throb in the
north-east, then it broke into two rays, and again united and
spread, and suddenly was withdrawn.  Mehalah had
often seen the Aurora, and she knew that the signals
portended increased cold or bad weather.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She seated herself on the mound, and drew her
cloak about her more closely, the damp cold bit into
her flesh; she knew she was safe from ague on the
burnt earth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her anger subsided, not that she resented the wrong
the less, but that her mind had passed to other
contemplations.  She was thinking of George, of her dead
hopes, of the blankness of the future before her.  A
little sunlight had fallen on her sad and monotonous
life, but it had been withdrawn, and had left her with
nothing to live for, save her mother.  Her heart had begun
to expand as a flower, and a frost had fallen on it, and
blackened its petals.  She brooded now on the past.
She wished for nothing in the future.  She had no care
for the present.  It was all one to her what befell her,
so long as her mother were cared for.  She had no one
else to love.  She was without a friend.  She would
resent an injury, and fight an enemy.  George might
have introduced her into a new world of gentleness, and
pity, and love.  Now the door to that world was shut
for ever, and she must beat her way through a world of
hard realities, where every man's hand was lifted against
his brother, and where was hate and resentment, and
exacting of the uttermost farthing.  She had gone forth
seeking help, and except from George, had found none.
Mrs. De Witt, Phoebe Musset, Admonition, such were
the women she had met; and the men were selfish as
Parson Till, fools as Charles Pettican, surly as Abraham
Dowsing, or brutal as Elijah Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Hark!—She caught the dip of an oar.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She drew in her breath and raised her head.  Then
she saw a boat shoot out of the mist, white and ghost-like
as the mist forms that stalked over the water, and
in the boat a man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There he was!  The sheep-stealer, come once more
to rob her mother and herself.  At once her furious
passion boiled up in her veins.  She saw before her the
man who had wronged her; she thought nothing of her
own weakness beside his strength, of there being no one
within call to come to her aid, should his arm be stouter
than hers.  She sprang to her feet with a shout, such
as an Indian might utter on leaping on his foe, and
rushed to the water's edge, just as the man had landed,
and had her hands at his throat in a moment.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You coward, you thief!' she cried shaking him
savagely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In an instant a pair of stronger hands had wrenched
her hands away and pinioned them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'By heaven! you wild cat, what are you flying at
me like that for?  What has brought you here at this
time of night?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah was abashed.  Her rage sank.  She had
mistaken her man.  This was no sheep-stealer.  She
could not speak, so great was her agitation.  She
writhed to free herself, but writhed in vain.  Elijah
laughed at her attempts.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What are you here for?' he asked again.  'Can
you not answer my question?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Some one has been stealing our ewes,' she said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And you took me for the thief,' said Rebow.  'Much
obliged for the compliment.  </span><em class="italics">Me</em><span>—the owner of Red
Hall, and the man that purchased the Ray, the farm
house, and the marshes and the saltings and all that
thereon is for eight hundred pounds, to be taken and
hanged for sheep-lifting!  A likely story, Glory.  You
must manage better another time.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What brings you here?' asked Mehalah sullenly,
angry with herself and with him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is the question I asked of you, and you return
it.  I will tell you.  I am out duck-shooting, but the
mist lies so thick on the water, and eats into the marrow
of the bones.  I could see no ducks, and I was freezing
in my punt; so I have come to lie with my gun on the
Burnt Hill awhile till the fog clears, as it will in an
hour, when I shall return.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Were you here yesterday night?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, I was not; I was up Tottesbury creek and got
a dozen pair of wild duck.  Will you have some?  I
have a pair or two in the punt.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have refused them before, and I refuse them again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why do you ask me if I were here yesternight?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Because then two sheep were taken.  Were you
here the night before?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, I was then on Abbots' Hall marshes.  Do you
suspect me still of sheep-stealing?' he asked scoffingly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not, but I thought had you been here you
might have seen some signs of the villains who have
robbed us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come here, Glory! out of the fog on to the Burnt
Hill.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am going home.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are not, till I have said what I have to say.
Come out of the ague damps.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am going home, now.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He held her by both wrists.  She was strong, but
her strength was nothing to his.  She made no great
effort to get away.  If he chose to speak to her, she
would listen to him.  If she struggled in his grasp, it
would make him think she feared him.  She would not
allow him to suppose himself of such importance to her.
If he insulted her, she had her pistol, and she would
not scruple to defend herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He drew her to the top of the mount; there they
were clear of the mist, which lay like snow below and
round them, covering the morass and the water.  The
clear cut crescent moon hung over a clump of pines on
Mersea.  Rebow looked at it, then waved an arm in the
direction.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you see Grim's Hoe yonder?—That great barrow
with the Scotch pines on top?  Do you know how
it comes there?  Have you heard the tale?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah was silent.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will tell you, for I often think of it, and so will
you when you have been told the tale.  In the old times
when the Danes came here, they wintered on Mersea Isle,
and in the summer they cruised all along the coast,
burning and plundering and murdering.  There were
two chiefs to them, brothers, who loved one another, they
were twins, born the same hour, and they had but one
heart and soul; what one willed that willed the other,
what one desired that the other desired also.  One
spring they sailed up the creek to St. Osyth's, and there
they took Osyth and killed her.  She had a sister, very
beautiful, and she fell to the lot of the brothers.  They
brought her back to Mersea, and then each would have
her for his own.  So the brothers fell out whose she
should be, and all their love turned to jealousy, and their
brotherhood to enmity, and it came about that they
fought with their long swords who should have the maid.
They fought, and smote, and hacked one another till
their armour was broken, and their flesh was cut off,
and their blood flowed away, and by nightfall they were
both dead.  Thereupon the Danes drew their ship up to
the top of the hill just above the Strood, and they
placed the maid in the hold with a dead brother on
either side of her, in his tattered harness, sword in hand,
and they heaped a mountain over them and buried them
all, the living and the dead together.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow paused, and pointed to the moon hung over
the hoe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'When the new moon appears, the flesh grows on
their bones, and the blood stanches, and the wounds
close, and breath comes back behind their ribs.  When
the moon is full they rise in the ship's hold and fall on
one another, and if you listen at full moon on the hoe
you can hear the brothers fighting below in the heart of
the barrow.  You hear them curse and cry out, and
you hear the clash of their swords.  But when the moon
wanes the sounds grow fainter, their armour falls to bits,
their flesh drops away, the blood oozes out of all the
hacked veins, and at last all is still.  Then, when there
is no moon, you can hear the maid mourning and sobbing:
you can hear her quite distinctly till the new
moon reappears, and then she is hushed, for the brothers
are recovering for a new fight.  This will go on month
after month, year after year, till one conquers the other
and wins the maid; but that will never be, for the
brothers are of the same age, and equally strong, and
equally resolute.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why have you told me this?' asked Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why have I told you this, Glory?' repeated Rebow;
'because you and I are like those brothers, only they
began with love and ended with fighting, and you and I
begin with fighting and must and shall end with love.
I love you, Glory, and yet, at times, I almost hate
you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And I,' broke in Mehalah, 'hate you with my whole
heart, and never, never can love you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You have a strong spirit, so have I,' said Elijah;
'I like to hear you speak thus.  For long you have let
me see that you have hated me: you have fought me
hard, but you shall love me yet.  We must fight, Glory;
it is our destiny.  We were made for one another, to
love and fight, and fight and love, till one has conquered
or killed the other.  How can you live at the Ray, and
I at Red Hall, apart?  You know, you feel it, that we
must be together to love and fight, and fight and love,
till death.  What is the use of your struggling against
what must come about?  As soon as ever I saw you I
knew that you were ordained for me from the moment
you were born.  You grew up and ripened for me, for
me, and no one else.  You thought you loved George
De Witt.  I hated you for loving him.  He was not
worthy of you, a poor, foolish, frightened sop.  You
would have taken him and turned him inside out and
torn him to pieces, in a week, disgusted with the fellow
that made calf-love to you, when you had sounded his
soul and found a bottom as soon as the lead went out of
your hand.  You thought George De Witt would belong
to you.  It could not be.  You cannot oppose your
destiny.  A strong soul like yours must not mate but
with a strong soul like mine.  Till I saw you I hated
women, poor, thin-headed, hollow-souled toys.  When I
saw you I saw the only woman who could be mine,
and I knew, as the pointers yonder know the polestar,
that you were destined to me.  You hate me because
you know this as well as I do.  You know that
there is no man on earth who can be yours save me,
but you will play and fight with your destiny.  Sooner
or later you must bend to it.  Sooner or later you must
give way.  You thought of George De Witt, and he
is swept out of your path.  You may fancy any other
man, and he will go this way or that, and nothing
will prosper till you set your face in the direction
whither your destiny points.  You can take no other
than me, however much you may desire it.  You need
me and I need you.  You may hate me and go on
hating me and fighting me to the last, but you cannot
escape me.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah,' said Mehalah, 'escape you I will.  Since I
have known you, you have been mixed up with all the
ills that have come upon us, I do not know how; but I
seem to feel that you are like an evil wind or a
blighting cloud passing over my life.  I would look up and
laugh, but I cannot, I turn hard, and hate the world—only
because you are in it.  It would be another world
without you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why do you turn hard and hate the world?
Because you are on a wrong road, you are battling
against your destiny.  All goes across with you, because
you are across your proper path.  Why do you hate
me?  Because you feel in your soul that you must
sooner or later be mine, and your haughty will rebels
against having your future determined for you.  Yet I
know it.  The time is at hand when you will take me
for better, for worse, for all life.  We cannot live a
moment the one without the other.  If I were to die
you would die too, you would rage and writhe against
death, but it would come.  I know it.  Our lives are
bound up together in one bundle, and the knife that
cuts one string cuts the other also.  Our souls are twins
to love and to hate, to fondle and fight, till death us do
part!  Till death us do part!' repeated Rebow scornfully,
'Death can no more part us than life.  We will live
together and we will die together, and moulder away
in one another's arms.  The worm that gnaws me shall
gnaw you.  I think of you night and day.  I cannot
help it: it is my fate.  I knew it was so the moment I
saw you.  I came here.  I cannot keep away till you
come to me to Red Hall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I shall never go there again,' said Mehalah sullenly,</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Not before New Year?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He laughed.  'She would swear to it, and yet at
the New Year she will be there.  And she will take me
and be mine.  For me she must and will love.  It is
her fate; she cannot oppose that for ever.  For me she
would even give up George De Witt.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George De Witt is dead.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I say, were it to come to this, George or Elijah,
one or the other, you would fly to Elijah and cast
George off.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me go.  I will have no more of this mad
babble,' said Mehalah, wrenching her hands out of his
grasp.  She would not run away.  She was too proud.
She folded her arms on her breast and confronted him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Hark!' she said, 'the Christmas bells.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Faint and far off could be heard the merry pealing
of the Colchester bells.  The wind had shifted.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Peace on earth and good will to men,' muttered
Elijah; 'but to them that fight against their destiny
fury and hate.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go back, Elijah, and speak to me no more on this
matter.  I will not hear you again.  I have but endured
it now.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is Christmas Eve,' said Rebow.  'In eight
days is the New Year, and then you will be in Red
Hall, Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Listen to me, Elijah,' exclaimed Mehalah passionately.

<p class="pfirst"><span>No more sheep were stolen; but then the moon was
filling her horns, and a robbery could not be committed
without chance of detection.  But though nothing
further had been taken, Mehalah was uneasy.  Some
evilly-disposed person had visited the Ray and
plundered her and her mother of four ewes; others, or the
same, might attempt the house, in the hopes of finding
money there.  The auction had shown people that
Mistress Sharland was not without money.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On New Year's Eve Mehalah went to Colchester to
make some purchases for the New Year.  The kalends
of January and not the Nativity of Christ is the great
winter festival among the Essex peasantry on the coast.
They never think of wishing one another a Happy
Christmas, but only a Merry New Year.  No yule log
is burnt, no mummers dance, no wassail bowl is
consumed at Christmas, but each man who can afford it
deems himself bound to riot and revel, to booze and sing,
to wake the death of the old year, and baptise the new
with libations of brandy or ale.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When Mehalah returned, she brought with her a new
lock and key for the house-door.  There had been once
a lock there, but it had been broken many years ago,
and had never been repaired.  On the Ray no lock was
needed, it had been supposed.  Mehalah was of a
different opinion now.  The short day had closed some
time ago; she had seen it die over Bradwell from
Abberton Hill, but the full moon was rising, and she
knew her way over the marshes, she could thread the
tangle easily by moonlight.  She reached the Ray, threw
open the door, and strode in.  Her mother was by the
fire, with her head on the table.  Mehalah's heart stood
still for a moment, and then her face flushed.  The
smell of spirits in the close room, the attitude of her
mother, the stupefied eyes which opened on her, and
then closed again without recognition, convinced her
that her mother had been drinking.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah was angry as well as distressed.  This was
a new trouble, one to which she was quite unaccustomed.
She knew that her mother had taken a little rum-and-water
against her ague, and she had not grudged it her.
But of late there had been something more than this.
Since Rebow had supplied Mrs. Sharland with spirits,
the old woman had been unable to resist the temptation
of going to her keg whenever she felt lonely or depressed.
Mehalah had insisted on her mother receiving no more
from Elijah Rebow, but she was by no means certain
that the widow had complied with her desire.  The
sight of her mother in this condition angered Mehalah,
for she was sure now that a fresh supply had been
obtained, and was secreted somewhere.  She was angry
with her mother for deceiving her and with Rebow for
tempting the old woman and laying her under an
obligation to him.  She was angry with herself for not
having watched her mother more closely, and explored
the places of concealment which abounded in the old
house.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She stood over her mother for some moments with
folded arms and bowed head, her brows knit, and a
gloomy light in her eyes.  Then she shook her roughly
and spoke harshly to her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother! answer me.  You have received more from
Rebow?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It was very kind, very kind indeed,' stuttered the
old woman.  'Capital for ague shivers and rheumatic
pains in the bones.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Has Elijah been here again?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He's wery civil; he knows what suits old bones.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Has he brought you another keg?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is stowed away,' said the widow drowsily.
'Quite comfortable.  Go to bed, Mehalah, it's time to
get up.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl drew back in disgust and wrath.  Elijah
was making her own mother despicable in her eyes.  She
was quite resolved what to do.  She thrust open the
door to the cellar, and behind a heap of faggots found
a fresh keg, evidently recently brought, and quite full.
She drew it forth into the front room and held it up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother!' she shouted.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am here, Mehalah.  The ague isn't on me yet.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you see this little cask?  It is full, quite full.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't do that, child, you may drop it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I shall dash it to pieces,' said the girl, and she
flung it with her whole force on the bricks.  A stave
was broken: the precious liquor spurted out.  Some
flew into the fire and flashed into blue flame up the
chimney.  In a moment the floor was swimming, and
the thirsty bricks were sucking in the spirit.  The old
woman was too besotted with drink to understand what
was done.  Mehalah's bosom heaved with passion and
excitement.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have done with that,' she said; 'I said that I
would, and I have kept my word.  Never, never shall
my poor mother be like this again.  He did it.'  She
knit her hands, and a fire flickered in her eye, like
that of the burning spirit in the chimney.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now come to bed, mother.'  She drew or carried
the old woman out of the room, undressed her, and put
her in bed.  Mrs. Sharland made no resistance.  She
submitted drowsily, and her head was no sooner on the
pillow than she fell asleep.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah returned to the front room.  She got out
some tools and set herself to work at once to fasten
on the lock.  She was accustomed to doing all sorts of
things herself; she could roughly carpenter, she had
often patched her boat.  The old farmhouse was in a
decayed condition and needed much mending, and for
several years she had done what was required to it.  To
put on a lock was a trifle; but the old nails that had
fastened the former lock remained in the wood, and had
to be punched out, and the keyhole was not quite in
the right place when the lock was first put on, and had
to be altered.  At length the lock was fast, a strong
lock, strong for such a worm-eaten door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah went to her mother's room and looked at
the old woman.  She slept heavily, unlike her usual
sleep, which would be broken at once by the entry of
her daughter with a light.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah returned to the kitchen and seated herself
at the hearth.  How long had this keg of spirits been
in the house?  She had paid no attention to the
introduction of spirits since George's death, her mind had
been occupied with other matters.  Her mother and
Rebow had taken advantage of this.  How was it that
Rebow came to the house when she was away?  He
never came when she was present, at least not since the
night when the money was stolen; but she was sure
that he visited her mother during her absence, from
little things let drop by the old woman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How did he manage to time his visits so as not to
meet her?  She would find out when he was last at
the Ray Farm.  She sprang up, and went out of the
door, unlocking it to let herself go forth; and she
called Abraham.  There was no answer.  The old man
was already turned into his loft over the cowhouse, and
asleep.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She called him again, but with equal want of
success.  Not a thunderbolt falling on the thorns
beside the house would rouse him.  Mehalah knew that,
and went back to her seat by the fire, relocking the
door.  'I will ask him in the morning.  He must know.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She drew off her shoes, and put her bare feet on
the warm hearth.  She was without her guernsey and
cap, for she did not wear them when she went to
Colchester.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She fell, as was her wont, to thinking.  Since the
death of George, she had been accustomed to sit thus
over the fire, after her mother had retired.  She was
not thinking of him now, she was thinking of Elijah.
His words, his strange, mad, fierce words, came back to
her.  Was there a destiny shaping her life against her
will, and forcing her into his arms?  She shuddered
at the thought.  To hate and love, and love and hate,
year out, year in, that was what they were fated to do,
according to him.  That he was drawn towards her by
some attractive power exercised against her will, she
knew full well, but she would not allow that he exercised
the least attraction on her.  Yet she did feel that
there was some sort of spell upon her.  Hate him as
she did and would, she knew that she could not altogether
escape him, she had an instinctive consciousness that
she was held by him, she did not understand how, in
his hands.  Perhaps it was her destiny to hate and
fight him; for how long?  Love him she never could,
she never would.  There was an assurance in his manner
and tone which impressed her against her better
judgment.  He spoke as though it were but a matter of
time before she yielded herself wholly to him, and came
under his roof and joined her lot with his, for life and
for death.  What right had he to assume this?  What
grounds had he for this confidence?  None but a blind,
dogged conviction in his own mind that destiny had
ordained them for each other.  Then she thought of
the story of Grim's Hoe, of the two who loved and
hated, embraced and fought eternally therein, those
two destined from their mother's womb to be together
in life and death, with twin souls and bodies, who had
they lived in love might have rested in death, but as
they fought must fight on.  There they were, in the old
hollow womb of the ship down in the earth in darkness,
loving one another as brothers, fighting each other as
rivals; the conflict lasting till one shall master the
other, a thing that never can be, for both were born
with equal strength, and equal purpose, and equal
stubbornness of will.  The fumes of the spilled spirits
hung in the air, and stimulated Mehalah's brain.
Instead of stupefying, they quickened her mind into
activity.  Her heart beat.  She felt as if she were in
the ship hold watching the eternal conflict, and as if
she must take a part with one or the other; as if her
so doing would determine the victory.  But which
should she will to conquer, when each was the counterpart
of the other?  She could not bear this thought,
she could not endure the fumes of the spirit, it suffocated
her.  She sprang up.  The full moon was glaring in at
the window from a cloudless sky.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She opened the door.  The air was cold, but there
was little wind.  She could see on the south-east horizon,
at the highest point of the island, the great Hoe crowned
with black pines.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The moon was at full.  The old warriors were now
hewing at one another, and the dim, frightened captive
maid looked on with her hands on her heart, her great
eyes gleaming like glow-worms in the decaying ship
hold.  Ha! at each sword stroke the sparks flashed.
Ha! the cut flesh glimmered like phosphorescent fish,
and the blood ran like blue fire.  Was the story true?
Could anyone hear the warriors shout and smite, who
chose to listen at the full of the moon?  The distance to
Grim's Hoe was not over two miles.  Mehalah thought
she must go there and listen with her own ears.  She
would go.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Once more she returned to her mother's room, and
saw that Mrs. Sharland was asleep.  Then she drew on
her shoes, her guernsey, and her red cap, went out, locked
the door, and put the key in her pocket.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who went there?'  She started.  She thought
she saw something—some one, move; but then laughed.
The moon was so bright that it cast her shadow on the
wall, distinct and black as if it were a palpable body.
She stood still, listened, and looked round.  She could
see the stretch of the saltings as distinctly as if it were
day, only that the shadows were inky black, not purple
as by sunlight.  Not a sound was to be heard.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will go,' she said, and she strode off towards the
causeway.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The path over the marshes was perfectly distinct.
She walked fast, the earth crackled under her feet, the
frost was keen.  Her eyes rose ever and anon to Grim's
Hoe.  The pines on it did not stir, they stood like
mourners above a grave.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Mersea channel gleamed like a belt of silver,
not a ripple was on the water on the west side of the
causeway, and but slight flapping wavelets, driven by
the north-east wind, played with the tangles on the piles
on the other side of the Strood.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She reached the island of Mersea by the causeway,
now dry, and began to ascend the hill.  Once she turned
and looked back.  She could see the Ray rising above
the marshes, bathed in moonlight, patched with coal
black shadows cast by the ancient thorn trees, and the
farm buildings.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Before her rose the great barrow, partly overgrown
with shrubs, but bare on the north-west towards the
Strood.  It was a bell-shaped mound rising some thirty
feet above the surface of the ground.  She paused a
moment at the foot and listened.  Not a sound.  She
must then climb the tumulus, and lie on the top between
the pines, and lay her ear to the ground.  She stepped
boldly up the little path trodden by children and sheep,
and in a few moments was at the top.  She stopped to
breathe, to look up at the wan white moon that gazed
down on her, and then she cast herself on the ground,
with her face to the north-west.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What was that?  A fir cone fell beside her.  There
was no sound.  Hist! a stoat ran past and disappeared
in a hole.  Then she heard screams.  A poor rabbit was
attacked and its blood sucked.  She lifted her head,
and then laid it on the ground again.  Her eyes were
fixed on the distance.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What was that?  In a moment she was on her feet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What was that red spot over the marshes, on the
Ray, among the trees?  What was that leaping, dancing,
lambent tongue, shooting up and recoiling?  What was
that white rising cloud above the thorns?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Before she knew where she was, Mehalah was flying
down the hill towards the Strood, the dead Danish
warriors forgotten in the agony of her fear.  As she ran
on, her eyes never left the Ray, and she saw the red
light grow in intensity and spread in body.  The farm
was on fire.  The house was on fire, and her mother
was in a dead sleep within—locked in—and the key
was in her pocket.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>O God! what had she done?  Why had she gone?
Had not the spilled spirits caught fire and set the house
in flames!  Why had she locked her mother in? a thing
never done before.  Mehalah ran, terror, horror, anguish
at her heart.  She did not look at her path, she took
it instinctively, she did not heed the rude bridges, she
dashed across them, and one broke under her hasty foot,
and fell away after she had passed.  The flames were
climbing higher.  She could see them devouring the
wooden tarred walls.  Then came a great burst of fire,
and a rushing upwards of blazing sparks.  The roof had
fallen in.  A pillar of blue and golden light stood up
and illumined the whole Ray.  The thorn trees looked
now like wondrous, finely-ramified, golden seaweeds in
a dim blue sea.  Mehalah would not pause to look at
anything, she saw only flames leaping and raging where
was her home, where lay her mother.  How could she
reach the place before the house was a wreck, and her
dear mother was buried beneath the burned timbers
of the roof, and the hot broken tiles?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She was there at last, before the great blaze; she
could see that some one or two men were present.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My mother, my mother!' she gasped, and fell on
her knees.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Be still, Glory, she is safe, no thanks to you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah lost consciousness for a few moments.  The
revulsion of feeling was so great as to overcome her.
When she recovered, she was still unable for some
time to gather all her faculties together, rise, look
round, and note what had taken place.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The whole farmhouse was on fire, every wall was
flaming, and part of the roof had fallen in.  If once
the house were to catch fire it was certain to go like
tinder.  A spout of flame came out of her mother's
bed-room window.  The fire glowed and roared in the
old kitchen sitting-room.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is my mother?' asked Mehalah abruptly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is all safe,' answered Abraham Dowsing, who
was dragging some saved bedding out of reach of the
sparks.  'She is in the boat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The cow?' asked Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is all right also.  The fire has not caught the
stable.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who got my mother out?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I did, Glory!' answered Elijah Rebow.  'You owe
her life to me.  Why were you not here?  Fighting
your destiny, I suppose.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Several articles were scattered about under the trees.
The Sharlands had not many valuables; such as they
had seemed to have been saved.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is my mother?  Lead me to her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is in the boat, Glory!' said Rebow.  'Come
with me.  The fire must burn itself out.  There is
nothing further to be done; we must put your mother
at once under shelter.  There is a cruel frost, and she
will suffer.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is she?  What have you done with her?'
again asked Mehalah, still hardly collected and conscious
of what she said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is safe in my boat, well wrapped up.  Come
with me.  You shall see her.  Abraham and my man
shall stay and watch till the fire dies out, and see that
no further harm is done, and then follow in your boat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where are you going?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am going to place your mother under cover, at
once, or the cold will kill her.  Come on, Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah led the way down the steep gravelly slope to
the Rhyn.  There floated his boat—his large two-oared
boat, and in the stern half lay, half crouched,
Mrs. Sharland, amidst blankets and bedding.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Joseph!' shouted Elijah to one of the men by the
fire, 'follow us as soon as you can, and bring Abraham
Dowsing with you.  We will fetch away the traps to-morrow.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland was wailing and wringing her hands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh Mehalah! this is dreadful! too dreadful!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Step in and take the oar,' said Elijah impatiently.
'We must get off, and house the old woman as soon as
possible, or she will be death-struck.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The flames were reflected in the water about the
boat, it seemed to float in fire.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Take the oar!' ordered Elijah gruffly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah obeyed mechanically.  He thrust the boat
off, and cast himself in.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>No word was spoken for some time, Mehalah's
eyes were fixed on her burning home, with despair.
Her brain was numb, her heart oppressed.  Mrs. Sharland
wailed and wept, and uttered loud reproaches
against Mehalah, which the girl heard not.  She was
stunned, and could not take in the situation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The boat shot past the head of the Ray.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There stood the low broad bulk of the Burnt Hill.
Mehalah roused herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah looked over his shoulder and laughed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Up Salcot Fleet!' he said shortly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What!' suddenly exclaimed Mehalah, as a pang
shot through her heart.  'Whither are we going?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To Red Hall,' answered Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not go there!' exclaimed the girl in a tone
of despair, as she drew her hands sharply from the oar,
and the boat swung round.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Take the oar again,' ordered Elijah.  'Where else
can your mother go?  You must think of her.  She
cannot be left to die of cold on the marshes, this night.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A groan escaped Mehalah's breast.  She resumed
the oar.  'Hold hard!' shouted Elijah after a row of
half-an-hour.  He sprang into the water, and drew the
boat ashore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Give your mother a hand and help her to land,' he
said peremptorily.  Mehalah obeyed without a word.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow caught the girl by both hands as she stepped
on shore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Welcome, Glory! welcome to Red Hall!  The new
year sees you under the roof where you shall rule as
mistress; your destiny is mightier than your will.'</span></p>
