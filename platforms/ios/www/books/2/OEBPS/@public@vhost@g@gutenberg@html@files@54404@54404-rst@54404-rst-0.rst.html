<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Between the mouths of the Blackwater and the Colne,
on the east coast of Essex, lies an extensive marshy
tract veined and freckled in every part with water.  It
is a wide waste of debatable ground contested by sea
and land, subject to incessant incursions from the former,
but stubbornly maintained by the latter.  At high tide
the appearance is that of a vast surface of moss or
Sargasso weed floating on the sea, with rents and patches
of shining water traversing and dappling it in all
directions.  The creeks, some of considerable length
and breadth, extend many miles inland, and are arteries
whence branches out a fibrous tissue of smaller channels,
flushed with water twice in the twenty-four hours.  At
noon-tides, and especially at the equinoxes, the sea
asserts its royalty over this vast region, and overflows
the whole, leaving standing out of the flood only the
long island of Mersea, and the lesser islet, called the
Ray.  This latter is a hill of gravel rising from the
heart of the Marshes, crowned with ancient thorntrees,
and possessing, what is denied the mainland, an
unfailing spring of purest water.  At ebb, the Ray can only
be reached from the old Roman causeway, called the
Strood, over which runs the road from Colchester to
Mersea Isle, connecting formerly the city of the
Trinobantes with the station of the count of the Saxon
shore.  But even at ebb, the Ray is not approachable
by land unless the sun or east wind has parched the
ooze into brick; and then the way is long, tedious and
tortuous, among bitter pools and over shining creeks.
It was perhaps because this ridge of high ground was
so inaccessible, so well protected by nature, that the
ancient inhabitants had erected on it a </span><em class="italics">rath</em><span>, or fortified
camp of wooden logs, which left its name to the place
long after the timber defences had rotted away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A more desolate region can scarce be conceived, and
yet it is not without beauty.  In summer, the thrift
mantles the marshes with shot satin, passing through
all gradations of tint from maiden's blush to lily white.
Thereafter a purple glow steals over the waste, as the
sea lavender bursts into flower, and simultaneously
every creek and pool is royally fringed with sea aster.
A little later the glass-wort, that shot up green and
transparent as emerald glass in the early spring, turns
to every tinge of carmine.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When all vegetation ceases to live, and goes to sleep,
the marshes are alive and wakeful with countless wild
fowl.  At all times they are haunted with sea mews
and roysten crows, in winter they teem with wild duck
and grey geese.  The stately heron loves to wade in the
pools, occasionally the whooper swan sounds his loud
trumpet, and flashes a white reflection in the still blue
waters of the fleets.  The plaintive pipe of the curlew
is familiar to those who frequent these marshes, and
the barking of the brent geese as they return from
their northern breeding places is heard in November.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the close of last century there stood on the Ray
a small farmhouse built of tarred wreckage timber, and
roofed with red pan-tiles.  The twisted thorntrees about
it afforded some, but slight, shelter.  Under the little
cliff of gravel was a good beach, termed a 'hard.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On an evening towards the close of September, a
man stood in this farmhouse by the hearth, on which
burnt a piece of wreckwood, opposite an old woman,
who crouched shivering with ague in a chair on the
other side.  He was a strongly built man of about
thirty-five, wearing fisherman's boots, a brown coat and
a red plush waistcoat.  His hair was black, raked over
his brow.  His cheekbones were high; his eyes dark,
eager, intelligent, but fierce in expression.  His nose
was aquiline, and would have given a certain nobility
to his countenance, had not his huge jaws and heavy
chin contributed an animal cast to his face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He leaned on his duck-gun, and glared from under
his pent-house brows and thatch of black hair over the
head of the old woman at a girl who stood behind, leaning
on the back of her mother's chair, and who returned
his stare with a look of defiance from her brown eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl might have been taken for a sailor boy, as
she leaned over the chairback, but for the profusion of
her black hair.  She wore a blue knitted guernsey
covering body and arms, and across the breast, woven
in red wool, was the name of the vessel, 'Gloriana.'  The
guernsey had been knitted for one of the crew of a
ship of this name, but had come into the girl's possession.
On her head she wore the scarlet woven cap of a boatman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The one-pane window at the side of the fireplace
faced the west, and the evening sun lit her brown gipsy
face, burnt in her large eyes, and made coppery lights
in her dark hair.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman was shivering with the ague, and
shook the chair on which her daughter leaned; a cold
sweat ran off her brow, and every now and then she
raised a white faltering hand to wipe the drops away
that hung on her eyebrows like rain on thatching.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I did not catch the chill here,' she said.  'I
ketched it more than thirty years ago when I was on
Mersea Isle, and it has stuck in my marrow ever since.
But there is no ague on the Ray.  This is the healthiest
place in the world, Mehalah has never caught the ague
on it.  I do not wish ever to leave it, and to lay my
bones elsewhere.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then you will have to pay your rent punctually,'
said the man in a dry tone, not looking at her, but at
her daughter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Please the Lord so we shall, as we ever have done,'
answered the woman; 'but when the chill comes on
me——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, curse the chill,' interrupted the man; 'who
cares for that except perhaps Glory yonder, who has to
work for both of you.  Is it so, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl thus addressed did not answer, but folded
her arms on the chairback, and leaned her chin upon
them.  She seemed at that moment like a wary cat
watching a threatening dog, and ready at a moment
to show her claws and show desperate battle, not out of
malice, but in self-defence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, but for you sitting there, sweating and
jabbering, Glory would not be bound to this lone islet,
but would go out and see the world, and taste life.  She
grows here like a mushroom, she does not live.  Is it
not so, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl's face was no longer lit by the declining sun,
which had glided further north-west, but the flames of
the driftwood flickered in her large eyes that met those
of the man, and the cap was still illumined by the
evening glow, a scarlet blaze against the indigo gloom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you lost your tongue, Glory?' asked the man,
impatiently striking the bricks with the butt end of his
gun.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why do you not speak, Mehalah?' said the mother,
turning her wan wet face aside, to catch a glimpse of her
daughter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I've answered him fifty times,' said the girl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No,' protested the old woman feebly, 'you have
not spoken a word to Master Rebow.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'By God, she is right,' broke in the man.  'The
little devil has a tongue in each eye, and she has been
telling me with each a thousand times that she hates
me.  Eh, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl rose erect, set her teeth, and turned her
face aside, and looked out at the little window on the
decaying light.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow laughed aloud.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She hated me before, and now she hates me worse,
because I have become her landlord.  I have bought the
Ray for eight hundred pounds.  The Ray is mine, I
tell you.  Mistress Sharland, you will henceforth have
to pay me the rent, to me and to none other.  I am
your landlord, and Michaelmas is next week.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The rent shall be paid, Elijah!' said the widow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The Ray is mine,' pursued Rebow, swelling with
pride.  'I have bought it with my own money—eight
hundred pounds.  I could stubb up the trees if I would.
I could cart muck into the well and choke it if I would.
I could pull down the stables and break them up for
firewood if I chose.  All here is mine, the Ray, the
marshes, and the saltings,[1] the creeks, the fleets, the
farm.  That is mine,' said he, striking the wall with
his gun, 'and that is mine,' dashing the butt end against
the hearth; 'and you are mine, and Glory is mine.'</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="noindent pfirst"><span class="small">[1] A salting is land occasionally flooded,
otherwise serving as
pasturage.  A marsh is a reclaimed salting,
enclosed within a sea-wall.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>'That never,' said the girl stepping forward, and
confronting him with dauntless eye and firm lips and
folded arms.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Eh!  Gloriana! have I roused you?' exclaimed
Elijah Rebow, with a flash of exultation in his fierce
eyes.  'I said that the house and the marshes, and the
saltings are mine, I have bought them.  And your
mother and you are mine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never,' repeated the girl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But I say yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We are your tenants, Elijah,' observed the widow
nervously interposing.  'Do not let Mehalah anger you.
She has been reared here in solitude, and she does not
know the ways of men.  She means nothing by her
manner.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do,' said the girl, 'and he knows it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is a headlong child,' pursued the old woman,
'and when she fares to say or do a thing, there is no
staying tongue or hand.  Do not mind her, master.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The man paid no heed to the woman's words, but
fixed his attention on the girl.  Neither spoke.  It was
as though a war of wills was proclaimed and begun.
He sought to beat down her defences with the force of
his resolve flung at her from his dark eyes, and she
parried it dauntlessly with her pride.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'By God!' he said at last, 'I have never seen anywhere
else a girl of your sort.  There is none elsewhere.
I like you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I knew it,' said the mother with feeble triumph in
her palsied voice.  'She is a right good girl at heart,
true as steel, and as tough in fibre.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have bought the house and the pasture, and the
marshes and the saltings,' said Elijah sulkily, 'and all
that thereon is.  You are mine, Glory!  You cannot
escape me.  Give me your hand.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She remained motionless, with folded arms.  He
laid his heavy palm on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Give me your hand, and mine is light; I will help
you.  Let me lay it on you and it will crush you.
Escape it you cannot.  This way or that.  My hand will
clasp or crush.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not stir.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The wild fowl that fly here are mine, the fish that
swim in the fleets are mine,' he went on; 'I can shoot
and net them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'So can I, and so can anyone,' said the girl
haughtily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let them try it on,' said Elijah; 'I am not one to
be trifled with, as the world well knows.  I will bear no
poaching here.  I have bought the Ray, and the fish
are mine, and the fowl are mine, and you are mine also.
Let him touch who dares.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The wild fowl are free for any man to shoot, the
fish are free for any man to net,' said the girl scornfully.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is not my doctrine,' answered Elijah.  'What
is on my soil and in my waters is mine, I may do with
them what I will, and so also all that lives on my estate
is mine.'  Returning with doggedness to his point, 'As
you live in my house and on my land, you are mine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother,' said the girl, 'give him notice, and quit
the Ray.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I could not do it, Mehalah, I could not do it,'
answered the woman.  'I've lived all my life on the
marshes, and I cannot quit them.  But this is a healthy
spot, and not like the marshes of Dairy House where
once we were, and where I ketched the chill.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You cannot go till you have paid me the rent,'
said Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That,' answered Mehalah, 'we will do assuredly.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'So you promise, Glory!' said Rebow.  'But should
you fail to do it, I could take every stick here:—That
chair in which your mother shivers, those dishes yonder,
the bed you sleep in, the sprucehutch[2] in which you
keep your clothes.  I could pluck the clock, the heart
of the house, out of it.  I could tear that defiant red
cap off your head.  I could drive you both out
without a cover into the whistling east wind and biting
frost.'</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>'I tell you, we can and we will pay.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But should you not be able at any time, I warn
you what to expect.  I've a fancy for that jersey you
wear with "Gloriana" right across the breast.  I'll pull
it off and draw it on myself.'  He ground his teeth.
'I will have it, if only to wrap me in, in my grave.  I
will cross my arms over it, as you do now, and set my
teeth, and not a devil in hell shall tear it off me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I tell you we will pay.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me alone, let me talk.  This is better than
money.  I will rip the tiling off the roof and fling it
down between the rafters, if you refuse to stir; I will
cast it at your mother and you, Glory.  The red cap
will not protect your skull from a tile, will it?  And
yet you say, I am not your master.  You do not belong
to me, as do the marshes and the saltings, and the wild
duck.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I tell you we will pay,' repeated the girl
passionately, as she wrenched her shoulder from his iron
grip.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You don't belong to me!' jeered Elijah.  Then
slapping the arm of the widow's chair, and pointing over
his shoulder at Mehalah, he said scornfully: 'She says
she does not belong to me, as though she believed it.  But
she does, and you do, and so does that chair, and the
log that smoulders on the hearth, and the very hearth
itself, with its heat, the hungry ever-devouring belly of
the house.  I've bought the Ray and all that is on it
for eight hundred pounds.  I saw it on the paper, it
stands in writing and may not be broke through.
Lawyers' scripture binds and looses as Bible scripture.
I will stick to my rights, to every thread and breath of
them.  She is mine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But, Elijah, be reasonable,' said the widow, lifting
her hand appealingly.  The fit of ague was passing
away.  'We are in a Christian land.  We are not slaves
to be bought and sold like cattle.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you cannot pay the rent, I can take everything
from you.  I can throw you out of this chair down on
those bricks.  I can take the crock and all the meat in
it.  I can take the bed on which you sleep.  I can take
the clothes off your back.'  Turning suddenly round on
the girl he glared, 'I will rip the jersey off her, and
wear it till I rot.  I will pull the red cap off her head
and lay it on my heart to keep it warm.  None shall
say me nay.  Tell me, mistress, what are you, what is
she, without house and bed and clothing?  I will take
her gun, I will swamp her boat.  I will trample down
your garden.  I will drive you both down with my dogs
upon the saltings at the spring tide, at the full of moon.
You shall not shelter here, on my island, if you will not
pay.  I tell you, I have bought the Ray.  I gave for it
eight hundred pounds.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But Elijah,' protested the old woman, 'do not be so
angry.  We are sure to pay.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We will pay him, mother, and then he cannot open
his mouth against us.'  At that moment the door flew
open, and two men entered, one young, the other old.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is the money,' said the girl, as the latter laid
a canvas bag on the table.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We've sold the sheep—at least Abraham has,' said
the young man joyously, as he held out his hand.
'Sold them well, too, Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl's entire face was transformed.  The cloud
that had hung over it cleared, the hard eyes softened,
and a kindly light beamed from them.  The set lips
became flexible and smiled.  Elijah saw and noted
the change, and his brow grew darker, his eye more
threatening.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah strode forward, and held out her hand
to clasp that offered her.  Elijah swung his musket
suddenly about, and unless she had hastily recoiled,
the barrel would have struck, perhaps broken, her
wrist.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You refused my hand,' he said, 'although you are
mine.  I bought the Ray for eight hundred pounds.'  Then
turning to the young man with sullenness, he
asked, 'George De Witt, what brings you here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, cousin, I've a right to be here as well as you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, you have not.  I have bought the Ray, and no
man sets foot on this island against my will.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The young man laughed good-humouredly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You won't keep me off your property then, Elijah,
so long as Glory is here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah made a motion as though he would speak
angrily, but restrained himself with an effort.  He
said nothing, but his eyes followed every movement of
Mehalah Sharland.  She turned to him with an exultant
splendour in her face, and pointing to the canvas bag
on the table, said, 'There is the money.  Will you take
the rent at once, or wait till it is due?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is not due till next Thursday.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We do not pay for a few weeks.  Three weeks'
grace we have been hitherto allowed.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I give no grace.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then take your money at once.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not touch it till it is due.  I will take
it next Thursday.  You will bring it me then to Red
Hall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Is the boat all right where I left her?' asked the
young man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, George!' answered the girl, 'she is on the
hard where you anchored her this morning.  What have
you been getting in Colchester to-day?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have bought some groceries for mother,' he said,
'and there is a present with me for you.  But that I
will not give up till by-and-bye.  You will help me to
thrust the boat off, will you not, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is afloat now.  However, I will come presently,
I must give Abraham first his supper.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Thank ye,' said the old man.  'George de Witt
and me stopped at the Rose and had a bite.  I must go
at once after the cows.  You'll excuse me.'  He went
out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Will you stay and sup with us, George?' asked the
widow.  'There is something in the pot will be ready
directly.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Thank you all the same,' he replied, 'I want to be
back as soon as I can, the night will be dark; besides,
you and Glory have company.'  Then turning to Rebow
he added:</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'So you have bought the Ray.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then Glory and her mother are your tenants.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They are mine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I hope they will find you an easy landlord.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I reckon they will not,' said Elijah shortly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come along, Glory!' he called, abandoning the
topic and the uncongenial speaker, and turning to the
girl.  'Help me with my boat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't be gone for long, Mehalah!' said her mother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I shall be back directly.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah Rebow kept his mouth closed.  His face was
as though cast in iron, but a living fire smouldered
within and broke out through the eye-sockets, as lava
will lie hard and cold, a rocky crust with a fiery fluid
core within that at intervals glares out at fissures.
He did not utter a word, but he watched Glory go out
with De Witt, and then a grim smile curdled his rugged
cheeks.  He seated himself opposite the widow, and
spread his great hands over the fire.  He was pondering.
The shadow of his strongly featured face and expanded
hands was cast on the opposite wall; as the flame
flickered, the shadow hands seemed to open and shut, to
stretch and grasp.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The gold had died out of the sky and only a pearly
twilight crept in at the window, the evening heaven
seen through the pane was soft and cool in tone as the
tints of the Glaucus gull.  The old woman remained
silent.  She was afraid of the new landlord.  She had
long known him, longer known of him, she had never
liked him, and she liked less to have him now in a place
of power over her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently Rebow rose, slowly, from his seat, and
laying aside his gun said, 'I too have brought a present,
but not for Glory.  She must know nothing of this, it
is for you.  I put the keg outside the door under the
whitethorn.  I knew a drop of spirits was good for the
ague.  We get spirits cheap, or I would not give you
any.'  He was unable to do a gracious act without
marring its merit by an ungracious word.  'I will fetch it
in.  May it comfort you in the chills.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He went out of the house and returned with a
little keg under his arm.  'Where is it to go?' he
asked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, Master Rebow! this is good of you, and I am
thankful.  My ague does pull me down sorely.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Damn your ague, who cares about it!' he said
surlily.  'Where is the keg to go?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me roll it in,' said the old woman, jumping up.
'There are better cellars and storeplaces here than
anywhere between this and Tiptree Heath.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Saving mine at Red Hall, and those at Salcot Rising
Sun,' interjected the man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You see, Rebow, in times gone by, a great many
smuggled goods were stowed away here; but much does
not come this way now,' with a sigh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It goes to Red Hall instead,' said Rebow.  'Ah! if
you were there, your life would be a merry one.
There! take the keg.  I have had trouble enough
bringing it here.  You stow it away where you like,
yourself; and draw me a glass, I am dry.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He flung himself in the chair again, and let the old
woman take up and hug the keg, and carry it off to
some secure hiding-place where in days gone by many
much larger barrels of brandy and wine had been stored
away.  She soon returned.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have not tapped this,' she said.  'The liquor will
be muddy.  I have drawn a little from the other that
you gave me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah took the glass from her hand and tossed it off.
He was chuckling to himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will say a word for me to Glory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Rely on me, Elijah.  None has been so good to me
as you.  None has given me anything for my chill but
you.  But Mehalah will find it out, I reckon; she
suspects already.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He paid no heed to her words.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'So she is not mine, nor the house, nor the marshes,
nor the saltings, nor the fish and fowl!' he muttered
derisively to himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I paid eight hundred pounds for the Ray and all
that therein is,' he continued, 'let alone what I paid the
lawyer.'  He rubbed his hands.  Then he rose again,
and took his gun.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'm off,' he said, and strode to the door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the same moment Mehalah appeared at it, her
face clear and smiling.  She looked handsomer than
ever.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well!' snarled Rebow, arresting her, 'what did he
give you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is no concern of yours,' answered the girl, and
she tried to pass.  He put his fowling piece across the
door and barred the way.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What did he give you?' he asked in his dogged
manner.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I might refuse to answer,' she said carelessly, 'but
I do not mind your knowing; the whole Ray and
Mersea, and the world outside may know.  This!'  She
produced an Indian red silk kerchief, which she flung
over her shoulders and knotted under her chin.  With
her rich complexion, hazel eyes, dark hair and scarlet
cap, lit by the red fire flames, she looked a gipsy, and
splendid in her beauty.  Rebow dropped his gun, thrust
her aside with a sort of mad fury, and flung himself out
of the door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He is gone at last!' said the girl with a gay laugh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow put his head in again.  His lips were drawn
back and his white teeth glistened.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will pay the rent next Thursday.  I give no grace.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then he shut the door and was gone.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>'Mother,' said Mehalah, 'are you better now?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, the fit is off me, but I am left terribly weak.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, will you give me the medal?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What?  Your grandmother's charm?  You cannot
want it!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It brings luck, and saves from sudden death.  I
wish to give it to George.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, Mehalah!  This will not do.  You must keep
it yourself.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is mine, is it not?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, child; it is promised you, but it is not yours
yet.  You shall have it some future day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I want it at once, that I may give it to George.
He has made me a present of this red kerchief for my
neck, and he has given me many another remembrance,
but I have made him no return.  I have nothing that
I can give him save that medal.  Let me have it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It must not go out of the family, Mehalah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It will not.  You know what is between George
and me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman hesitated and excused herself, but
was so much in the habit of yielding to her daughter,
that she was unable in this matter to maintain her
opposition.  She submitted reluctantly, and crept out
of the room to fetch the article demanded of her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she returned, she found Mehalah standing
before the fire with her back to the embers, and her
hands knitted behind her, looking at the floor, lost in
thought.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There it is,' grumbled the old woman.  'But I
don't like to part with it; and it must not go out of
the family.  Keep it yourself, Mehalah, and give it
away to none.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl took the coin.  It was a large silver token,
the size of a crown, bearing on the face a figure of
Mars in armour, with shield and brandished sword,
between the zodiacal signs of the Ram and the
Scorpion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The reverse was gilt, and represented a square
divided into five-and-twenty smaller squares, each
containing a number, so that the sum in each row, taken
either vertically or horizontally, was sixty-five.  The
medal was undoubtedly foreign.  Theophrastus Paracelsus,
in his 'Archidoxa,' published in the year 1572,
describes some such talisman, gives instructions for its
casting, and says: 'This seal or token gives him who
carries it about him strength and security and victory
in all battles, protection in all perils.  It enables
him to overcome his enemies and counteract their
plots.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The medal held by the girl belonged to the sixteenth
century.  Neither she nor her mother had ever
heard of Paracelsus, and knew nothing of his
'Archidoxa.'  The figures on the face passed their
comprehension.  The mystery of the square on the reverse
had never been discovered by them.  They knew only
that the token was a charm, and that family tradition
held it to secure the wearer against sudden death by
violence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A hole was drilled through the piece, and a strong
silver ring inserted.  A broad silk riband of faded blue
passed through the ring, so that the medal might be
worn about the neck.  For a few moments Mehalah
studied the mysterious figures by the fire-light, then
flung the riband round her neck, and hid the coin and
its perplexing symbols in her bosom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must light a candle,' she said; then she stopped
by the table on her way across the room, and took up
the glass upon it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother,' she said sharply; 'who has been drinking
here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman pretended not to hear the question,
and began to poke the fire.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, has Elijah Rebow been drinking spirits out
of this glass?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To be sure, Mehalah, he did just take a drop.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Whence did he get it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't you think it probable that such a man as
he, out much on the marshes, should carry a bottle
about with him?  Most men go provided against the
chill who can afford to do so.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother,' said the girl impatiently, 'you are
deceiving me.  I know he got the spirits here, and that
you have had them here for some time.  I insist on
being told how you came by them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman made feeble and futile attempts to
evade answering her daughter directly; but was at last
forced to confess that on two occasions, of which this
evening was one, Elijah Rebow had brought her a small
keg of rum.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You do not grudge it me, Mehalah, do you?  It
does me good when I am low after my fits.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not grudge it you,' answered the girl; 'but
I do not choose you should receive favours from that
man.  He has to-day been threatening us, and yet
secretly he is making you presents.  Why does he come
here?'  She looked full in her mother's face.  'Why
does he give you these spirits?  He, a man who never
did a good action but asked a return in fourfold
measure.  I promise you, mother, if he brings here any
more, that I will stave in the cask and let the liquor
you so value waste away.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The widow made piteous protest, but her daughter
remained firm.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now,' said the girl, 'this point is settled between
us.  Be sure I will not go back from my word.  I will
in nothing be behoven to the man I abhor.  Now let
me count the money.'  She caught up the bag, then put
it down again.  She lit a candle at the hearth, drew
her chair to the table, seated herself at it, untied
the string knotted about the neck of the pouch, and
poured the contents upon the board.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She sprang to her feet with a cry; she stood as
though petrified, with one hand to her head, the other
holding the bag.  Her eyes, wide open with dismay,
were fixed on the little heap she had emptied on the
table—a heap of shot, great and small, some
penny-pieces, and a few bullets.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is the matter with you, Mehalah?  What
has happened?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl was speechless.  The old woman moved to
the table and looked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is this, Mehalah?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look here!  Lead, not gold.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There has been a mistake,' said the widow,
nervously, 'call Abraham; he has given you the wrong
sack.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There has been no mistake.  This is the right bag.
He had no other.  We have been robbed.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman was about to put her hand on the
heap, but Mehalah arrested it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do not touch anything here,' she said, 'let all
remain as it is till I bring Abraham.  I must ascertain
who has robbed us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She leaned her elbows on the table; she platted her
fingers over her brow, and sat thinking.  What could
have become of the money?  Where could it have been
withdrawn?  Who could have been the thief?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Abraham Dowsing, the shepherd, was a simple surly
old man, honest but not intelligent, selfish but
trustworthy.  He was a fair specimen of the East Saxon
peasant, a man of small reasoning power, moving like
a machine, very slow, muddy in mind, only slightly
advanced in the scale of beings above the dumb beasts;
with instinct just awaking into intelligence, but not
sufficiently awake to know its powers; more unhappy
and helpless than the brute, for instinct is exhausted in
the transformation process; not happy as a man, for he
is encumbered with the new gift, not illumined and
assisted by it.  He is distrustful of its power, inapt to
appreciate it, detesting the exercise of it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On the fidelity of Abraham Dowsing, Mehalah felt
assured she might rely.  He was guiltless of the
abstraction.  She relied on him to sell the sheep to the
best advantage, for, like everyone of low mental
organisation, he was grasping and keen to drive a bargain.
But when he had the money she knew that less confidence
could be reposed on him.  He could think of but one
thing at a time, and if he fell into company, his mind
would be occupied by his jug of beer, his bread and
cheese, or his companion.  He would not have attention
at command for anything beside.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The rustic brain has neither agility nor flexibility.
It cannot shift its focus nor change its point of sight.
The educated mind will peer through a needlehole in a
sheet of paper, and see through it the entire horizon
and all the sky.  The uncultured mind perceives nothing
but a hole, a hole everywhere without bottom, to be
recoiled from, not sounded.  When the oyster spat falls
on mud in a tidal estuary, it gets buried in mud deeper
with every tide, two films each twenty-four hours, and
becomes a fossil if it becomes anything.  Mind in the
rustic is like oyster spat, unformed, the protoplasm of
mind but not mind itself, daily, annually deeper buried
in the mud of coarse routine.  It never thinks, it scarce
lives, and dies in unconsciousness that it ever possessed
life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah sat considering, her mother by her, with
anxious eyes fastened on her daughter's face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The money must have been abstracted either in
Colchester or on the way home.  The old man had
said that he stopped and tarried at the Rose inn on the
way.  Had the theft been there committed?  Who had
been his associates in that tavern?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother,' said Mehalah suddenly, 'has the canvas
bag been on the table untouched since Abraham brought
it here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To be sure it has.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You have been in the room, in your seat all the
while?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Of course I have.  There was no one here but
Rebow.  You do not suspect him, do you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, I have no reason to do so.  You were here all
the while?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah dropped her brow again on her hands.
What was to be done?  It was in vain to question
Abraham.  His thick and addled brain would baffle
enquiry.  Like a savage, the peasant when questioned
will equivocate, and rather than speak the truth invent
a lie from a dim fear lest the truth should hurt him.
The lie is to him what his shell is to the snail, his place
of natural refuge; he retreats to it not only from
danger, but from observation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He does not desire to mislead the querist, but to
baffle observation.  He accumulates deception,
equivocation, falsehood about him just as he allows dirt to
clot his person, for his own warmth and comfort, not to
offend others.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl stood up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, I must go after George De Witt at once.
He was with Abraham on the road home, and he will
tell us the truth.  It is of no use questioning the old
man, he will grow suspicious, and think we are accusing
him.  The tide is at flood, I shall be able to catch
George on the Mersea hard.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Take the lanthorn with you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will.  The evening is becoming dark, and there
will be ebb as I come back.  I must land in the
saltings.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah unhung a lanthorn from the ceiling and
kindled a candle end in it, at the light upon the table.
She opened the drawer of the table and took out a
pistol.  She looked at the priming, and then thrust it
through a leather belt she wore under her guernsey.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On that coast, haunted by smugglers and other
lawless characters, a girl might well go armed.  By
the roadside to Colchester where cross ways met, was
growing an oak that had been planted as an acorn in
the mouth of a pirate of Rowhedge, not many years
before, who had there been hung in chains for men
murdered and maids carried off.  Nearly every man
carried a gun in hopes of bringing home wild fowl, and
when Mehalah was in her boat, she usually took her
gun with her for the same purpose.  But men bore
firearms not only for the sake of bringing home game;
self-protection demanded it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At this period, the mouth of the Blackwater was a
great centre of the smuggling trade; the number and
intricacy of the channels made it a safe harbour for
those who lived on contraband traffic.  It was easy for
those who knew the creeks to elude the revenue boats,
and every farm and tavern was ready to give cellarage
to run goods and harbour to smugglers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Between Mersea and the Blackwater were several
flat holms or islands, some under water at high-tides,
others only just standing above it, and between these
the winding waterways formed a labyrinth in which it
was easy to evade pursuit and entangle the pursuers.
The traffic was therefore here carried on with an
audacity and openness scarce paralleled elsewhere.
Although there was a coastguard station at the mouth
of the estuary, on Mersea 'Hard,' yet goods were run
even in open day under the very eyes of the revenue
men.  Each public-house on the island and on the
mainland near a creek obtained its entire supply of wine
and spirits from contraband vessels.  Whether the
coastguard were bought to shut their eyes or were baffled by
the adroitness of the smugglers, cannot be said, but
certain it was, that the taverns found no difficulty in
obtaining their supplies as often and as abundant as
they desired.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The villages of Virley and Salcot were the chief
landing-places, and there horses and donkeys were
kept in large numbers for the conveyance of the spirits,
wine, tobacco and silk to Tiptree Heath, the scene of
Boadicaea's great battle with the legions of Suetonius,
which was the emporium of the trade.  There a constant
fair or auction of contraband articles went on, and
thence they were distributed to Maldon, Colchester,
Chelmsford, and even London.  Tiptree Heath was a
permanent camping ground of gipsies, and squatters
ran up there rude hovels; these were all engaged in
the distribution of the goods brought from the sea.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But though the taverns were able to supply themselves
with illicit spirits, unchecked, the coastguard
were ready to arrest and detain run goods not destined
for their cellars.  Deeds of violence were not rare, and
many a revenue officer fell a victim to his zeal.  On
Sunken Island off Mersea, the story went, that a whole
boat's crew were found with their throats cut; they were
transported thence to the churchyard, there buried, and
their boat turned keel upwards over them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The gipsies were thought to pursue over-conscientious
and successful officers on the mainland, and remove
them with a bullet should they escape the smugglers on
the water.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The whole population of this region was more or
less mixed up with, and interested in, this illicit traffic,
and with defiance of the officers of the law, from the
parson who allowed his nag and cart to be taken from
his stable at night, left unbolted for the purpose, and
received a keg now and then as repayment, to the
vagabonds who dealt at the door far inland in silks and
tobacco obtained free of duty on the coast.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What was rare elsewhere was by no means uncommon
here, gipsies intermarried with the people, and settled
on the coast.  The life of adventure, danger, and
impermanence was sufficiently attractive to them to induce
them to abandon for it their roving habits; perhaps
the difference of life was not so marked as to make the
change distasteful.  Thus a strain of wild, restless,
law-defying gipsy blood entered the veins of the Essex
marshland populations, and galvanised into new life
the sluggish and slimy liquid that trickled through
the East Saxon arteries.  Adventurers from the Low
Countries, from France, even from Italy and
Spain—originally smugglers, settled on the coast, generally as
publicans, in league with the owners of the contraband
vessels, married and left issue.  There were neither
landed gentry nor resident incumbents in this district,
to civilise and restrain.  The land was held by yeomen
farmers, and by squatters who had seized on and enclosed
waste land, no man saying them nay.  At the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes a large number of Huguenot
French families had settled in the 'Hundreds' and the
marshes, and for full a century in several of the churches
divine service was performed alternately in French and
English.  To the energy of these colonists perhaps are
due the long-extended sea-walls enclosing vast tracts of
pasture from the tide.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Those Huguenots not only infused their Gallic blood
into the veins of the people, but also their Puritanic
bitterness and Calvinistic partiality for Old Testament
names.  Thus the most frequent Christian names met
with are those of patriarchs, prophets and Judaic kings,
and the sire-names are foreign, often greatly corrupted.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Yet, in spite of this infusion of strange ichor from all
sides, the agricultural peasant on the land remains
unaltered, stamped out of the old unleavened dough of Saxon
stolidity, forming a class apart from that of the farmers
and that of the seamen, in intelligence, temperament,
and gravitation.  All he has derived from the French
element which has washed about him has been a nasal
twang in his pronunciation of English.  Yet his dogged
adherence to one letter, which was jeopardised by the
Gallic invasion, has reacted, and imposed on the
invaders, and the </span><em class="italics">v</em><span> is universally replaced on the Essex
coast by a </span><em class="italics">w</em><span>.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the plaster and oak cottages away from the sea,
by stagnant pools, the hatching places of clouds of
mosquitos, whence rises with the night the haunting
spirit of tertian ague, the hag that rides on, and takes
the life out of the sturdiest men and women, and shakes
and wastes the vital nerves of the children, live the old
East Saxon slow moving, never thinking, day labourers.
In the tarred wreck-timber cabins by the sea just above
the reach of the tide, beside the shingle beach, swarms
a yeasty, turbulent, race of mixed-breeds, engaged in
the fishery and in the contraband trade.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah went to the boat.  It was floating.  She
placed the lanthorn in the bows, cast loose, and began
to row.  She would need the light on her return, perhaps,
as with the falling tide she would be unable to reach
the landing-place under the farmhouse, and be forced
to anchor at the end of the island, and walk home across
the saltings.  To cross these without a light on a dark
night is not safe even to one knowing the lie of the land.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A little light still lingered in the sky.  There was
a yellow grey glow in the west over the Bradwell shore.
Its fringe of trees, and old barn chapel standing across
the walls of the buried city Othona, stood sombre against
the light, as though dabbed in pitch on a faded golden
ground.  The water was still, as no wind was blowing,
and it reflected the sky and the stars that stole out, with
such distinctness that the boat seemed to be swimming
in the sky, among black tatters of clouds, these being
the streaks of land that broke the horizon and the
reflection.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Gulls were screaming, and curlew uttered their
mournful cry.  Mehalah rowed swiftly down the Rhyn,
as the channel was called that divided the Ray from the
mainland, and that led to the 'hard' by the Rose inn,
and formed the highway by which it drew its supplies,
and from which every farm in the parish of Peldon
carried its casks of strong liquor.  To the west extended
a vast marsh from which the tide was excluded by a
dyke many miles in length.  Against the northern
horizon rose the hill of Wigborough crowned by a church
and a great tumulus, and some trees that served as
landmarks to the vessels entering the Blackwater.  In
ancient days the hill had been a beacon station, and it
was reconverted to this purpose in time of war.  A man
was placed by order of Government in the tower, to
light a crescet on the summit, in answer to a similar
beacon at Mersea, in the event of a hostile fleet being
seen in the offing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now and then the boat—it was a flat-bottomed
punt—hissed among the asters, as Mehalah shot over tracts
usually dry, but now submerged; she skirted next a bed
of bulrushes.  These reeds are only patient of occasional
flushes with salt water, and where they grow it is at
the opening of a land drain, or mark a fresh spring.
Suddenly as she was cutting the flood, the punt was
jarred and arrested.  She looked round.  A boat was
across her bows.  It had shot out of the rushes and
stopped her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Whither are you going, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The voice was that of Elijah Rebow, the last man
Mehalah wished to meet at night, when alone on the
water.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is my affair, not yours,' she answered.  'I am
in haste, let me pass.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not.  I will not be treated like this, Glory.
I have shot you a couple of curlew, and here they are.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He flung the birds into her boat.  Mehalah threw
them back again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let it be an understood thing between us, Elijah,
that we will accept none of your presents.  You have
brought my mother a keg of rum, and I have sworn to
beat in the head of the next you give her.  She will
take nothing from you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There you are mistaken, Glory; she will take as
much as I will give her.  You mean that you will not.
I understand your pride, Glory! and I love you for it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I care nothing for your love or your hate.  We are
naught to each other.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes we are, I am your landlord.  We shall see how
that sentiment of yours will stand next Thursday.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you mean?' asked Mehalah hastily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do I mean?  Why, I suppose I am intelligible
enough in what I say for you to understand me
without explanation.  When you come to pay the rent
to me next Thursday, you will not be able to say we are
naught to each other.  Why! you will have to pay me
for every privilege of life you enjoy, for the house you
occupy, for the marshes that feed your cow and swell its
udder with milk, for the saltings on which your sheep
fatten and grow their wool.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The brave girl's heart failed for a moment.  She
had not the money.  What would Elijah say and do
when he discovered that she and her mother were
defaulters?  However, she put a bold face on the matter
now, and thrusting off the boat with her oar, she said
impatiently, 'You are causing me to waste precious
time.  I must be back before the water is out of the
fleets.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Whither are you going?' again asked Rebow, and
again he drove his boat athwart her bows.  'It is not
safe for a young girl like you to be about on the water
after nightfall with ruffians of all sorts poaching on my
saltings and up and down my creeks.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am going to Mersea City,' said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are going to George De Witt.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What if I am?  That is no concern of yours.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He is my cousin.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I wish he were a cousin very far removed from you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh Glory! you are jesting.'  He caught the side
of the punt with his hand, for she made an effort to
push past him.  'I shall not detain you long.  Take
these curlew.  They are plump birds; your mother
will relish them.  Take them, and be damned to your
pride.  I shot them for you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not have them, Elijah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then I will not either,' and he flung the dead birds
into the water.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She seized the opportunity, and dipping her oars in
the tide, strained at them, and shot away.  She heard
him curse, for his boat had grounded and he could not
follow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She laughed in reply.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In twenty minutes Mehalah ran her punt on Mersea
beach.  Here a little above high-water mark stood a
cluster of wooden houses and an old inn, pretentiously
called the 'City,' a hive of smugglers.  On the shore,
somewhat east, and away from the city, lay a dismasted
vessel, fastened upright by chains, the keel sunk in the
shingle.  She had been carried to this point at spring
flood and stranded, and was touched, not lifted by the
ordinary tides.  Mehalah's punt, drawing no draught,
floated under the side of this vessel, and she caught the
ladder by which access was obtained to the deck.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who is there?' asked George De Witt, looking over
the side.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am come after you, George,' answered Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, Glory! what is the matter?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is something very serious the matter.  You
must come back with me at once to the Ray.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Is your mother ill?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Worse than that.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Dead?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, no! nothing of that sort.  She is all right.
But I cannot explain the circumstances now.  Come at
once and with me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will get the boat out directly.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never mind the boat.  Come in the punt with me.
You cannot return by water to-night.  The ebb will
prevent that.  You will be obliged to go round by
the Strood.  Tell your mother not to expect you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But what is the matter, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will tell you when we are afloat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I shall be back directly, but I do not know how
the old woman will take it.'  He swung himself down
into the cabin, and announced to his mother that he
was going to the Ray, and would return on foot by the
Strood.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A gurgle of objurgations rose from the hatchway,
and followed the young man as he made his escape.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I wouldn't have done it for another,' said he; 'the
old lady is put out, and will not forgive me.  It will
be bad walking by the Strood, Glory!  Can't you put
me across to the Fresh Marsh?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If there is water enough I will do so.  Be quick
now.  There is no time to spare.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He came down the ladder and stepped into the punt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Give me the oars, Glory.  You sit in the stern
and take the lanthorn.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is in the bows.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I know that.  But can you not understand, Glory,
that when I am rowing, I like to see you.  Hold the
lanthorn so that I may get a peep of your face now and
then.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do not be foolish, George,' said Mehalah.  However,
she did as he asked, and the yellow dull light fell
on her face, red handkerchief and cap.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You look like a witch,' laughed De Witt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will steer, row as hard as you can, George,' said
the girl; then abruptly she exclaimed, 'I have something
for you.  Take it now, and look at it afterwards.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She drew the medal from her bosom, and passing
the riband over her head, leaned forward, and tossed
the loop across his shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't upset the boat, Glory!  Sit still; a punt is
an unsteady vessel, and won't bear dancing in.  What
is it that you have given me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A keepsake.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I shall always keep it, Glory, for the sake of the girl
I love best in the world.  Now tell me; am I to row
up Mersea channel or the Rhyn?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is water enough in the Rhyn, though we
shall not be able to reach our hard.  You row on, and
do not trouble yourself about the direction, I will steer.
We shall land on the Saltings.  That is why I have
brought the lanthorn with me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What are you doing with the light?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must put it behind me.  With the blaze in my
eyes I cannot see where to steer.'  She did as she
said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now tell me, Glory, what you have hung round my neck.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is a medal, George.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Whatever it be, it comes from you, and is worth
more than gold.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is worth a great deal.  It is a certain charm.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Indeed!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It preserves him who wears it from death by violence.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the word a flash shot out of the rushes, and a
bullet whizzed past the stern.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>George De Witt paused on his oars, startled,
confounded.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The bullet was meant for you or me,' said Mehalah
in a low voice.  'Had the lanthorn been in the bows
and not in the stern it would have struck you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then she sprang up and held the lanthorn aloft,
above her head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Coward, whoever you are, skulking in the reeds.
Show a light, if you are a man.  Show a light as I do.
and give me a mark in return.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'For heaven's sake, Glory, put out the candle,'
exclaimed De Witt in agitation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Coward! show a light, that I may have a shot at
you,' she cried again, without noticing what George
said.  In his alarm for her and for himself, he raised his
oar and dashed the lanthorn out of her hand.  It fell,
and went out in the water.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah drew her pistol from her belt, and cocked it.
She was standing, without trembling, immovable in the
punt, her eye fixed unflinching on the reeds.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George,' she said, 'dip the oars.  Don't let her float
away.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He hesitated.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently a slight click was audible, then a feeble
flash, as from flint struck with steel in the pitch
blackness of the shore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then a small red spark burned steadily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Not a sound, save the ripple of the retreating tide.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah's pistol was levelled at the spark.  She
fired, and the spark disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She and George held their breath.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have hit,' she said.  'Now run the punt in where
the light was visible.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, Glory; this will not do.  I am not going to
run you and myself into fresh danger.'  He struck out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George, you are rowing away!  Give me the
oars.  I will find out who it was that fired at us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is foolhardiness,' he said, but obeyed.  A
couple of strokes ran the punt among the reeds.
Nothing was to be seen or heard.  The night was dark
on the water, it was black as ink among the rushes.
Several times De Witt stayed his hand and listened,
but there was not a sound save the gurgle of the water,
and the song of the night wind among the tassels and
harsh leaves of the bulrushes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is aground,' said De Witt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We must back into the channel, and push on to
the Ray,' said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The young man jumped into the water among the
roots of the reeds, and drew the punt out till she floated;
then he stepped in and resumed the oars.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Hist!' whispered De Witt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Both heard the click of a lock.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Down!' he whispered, and threw himself in the
bottom of the punt.</span></p>
