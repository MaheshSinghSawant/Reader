<p class="pfirst"><span>Elijah Rebow sank into a sullen fierce silence.  He
scarcely stirred from the house except to the forge,
where he groped among the dead ashes for the iron
ring, which however he never found.  He sat in his
hall, smoking, his elbows on the arms of his chair, his
head sunk on his breast, with his dull eyes on the floor.
He seemed brooding over something, which occupied
all his thoughts, and he rarely spoke.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There had been little difficulty in getting rid of
Timothy.  He lingered a day or two about Salcott and
Red Hall, but as he met with angry repulse from
Rebow, and no encouragement from Mehalah, he
abandoned the ground as unproductive.  He was an
idle, good-for-nothing young man, hating work, and
when he was obliged to leave comfortable quarters at
Wyvenhoe, hoped to settle himself into a similar
position at Salcott.  He was conceited, and fancied himself
able to make conquests when he liked, and never for a
moment doubted that his looks and address would have
ingratiated him with Mehalah, and won him a lodgment
in the house.  He had been hovering about Phoebe
Musset for some time, as she was thought to have
money.  Her parents had no other child, and the farm
and shop would have suited him.  When he met with
a rebuff at Red Hall he betook himself to Mersea,
and was much surprised to be received there with
coldness where he had expected warmth.  The reason was
that George De Witt had returned, a sailor in the Royal
Navy, covered with glory according to his own account,
and Phoebe was more disposed to set her cap at him
than flirt with the shore-loafer, Timothy Spark.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As Mehalah was crossing the farmyard one day, old
Abraham Dowsing stopped her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I want to speak along of you,' he said in his
uncouth, abrupt manner.  'What does the master mean
by his goings on?  I saw him to-day after his dinner
sitting with the great knife in his hand.  The door was
open and I was at the bottom of the steps, and I looked
up, and there he was making stabs with it into the air.
Then he got up, and holding the knife behind him, he
crept over towards your mother's leather-backed chair.
I seed him feel at it, and when he did touch it, then
there came a wild look over his face, and he out with
the carving knife, quick as thought, and he clutched
the back of the chair with his left, and dug the blade
right into the leather, and it came through at the back.
You look next time you go into the hall.  I guess he's
going as his brother did.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Going out of his mind, Abraham?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, I reckon.  What else does it all mean?  It is
either that, or there is something that deadly angers him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He looked with a cunning covert glance at her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is not that these matters concern me, over much,
but I don't want to change places in my old age.  I'm
comfortable enough here.  I gets my wittles regular,
and my swipes of ale.  Take care of yourself, Mistress.
I've heard as how the master got somebody pressed
when he was in the way,—there's a tale about it abroad.
He won't stand that party about here much, and I
wouldn't adwise the encouragement of him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George De Witt is my friend.  He may come when
he likes,' said Mehalah gravely.  'He and I have
known one another since we were children, and my
marriage need not destroy an old friendship.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I mentioned no names,' said the old man.  'You
can't say I did.  One thing I be sure of.  Whenever
somebody comes here, the master knows it; he knows
it by a sort of instinct, I fancy.  I see him at the head
of the steps looking out as though he could see, and
biting at the air, just as a mad dog snaps at everything
and nothing.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is George!' suddenly exclaimed Mehalah,
as she saw the young sailor's figure rise on the sea-wall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And there is the master,' muttered Abraham,
pointing to Elijah, who appeared at his door, peering
about, and holding his hand to his ear.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah hesitated a moment, and then went up the
steps to him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you want to come down?' she asked; 'shall I
lead you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, help me.'  He clutched her hand by the wrist
and came out and stood on the stair.  Then he grasped
her shoulder with the other hand, and he began to shake
and twist her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She could see into his heart as into clear water,
to the ugly snags and creeping things at the bottom.
She saw that the temptation had come on him to fling
her down: but she saw also that it was immediately
overcome.  He knew she read his thoughts.  'The
height is not much,' he muttered; 'you might sprain
an ankle but not break your neck.  I will not hurt you,
do not fear.  Hurt you!  Good God!  I would not hurt
you, not give you one moment's pain, I would bear
hours of agony rather than make you suffer for one
second.  But what must be, must be!  There is no way
out of the marsh but over the dyke.  There is no peace
which is not won by a fight and wounds.  Let me go
back.'  He drew her in at the door, a ferocious
expression flickered over his face, like phosphorescent
illumination over dead fish.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot endure this longer.  Mehalah! you are
killing me.  This is worse than the fire-juice in my
eyes, you are drenching my heart and brain in vitriol,
I feel it gnawing and stinging and blackening as
it consumes a way to the inner core, leaving charred
matter behind.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What am I doing, to make you suffer?' she asked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are doing all you can.  I cannot, I will not
endure that agony.  Have you seen the coal heap in
the forge, how the fire rages and glows within before
the blast?  Water is thrown on without quenching the
fire, it only intensifies its heat.  At last the black mass
cracks on all sides and the white fury shoots out in spits
and knives of flame.  It is so with me.  The fire is
here.'  He smote his breast and then his brain.  'It is
raging, panting, whitening, intensifying, and at last it
will break out on all sides.  Who is blowing the fire
into vehemence?  It is you—you—you!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He gathered himself up, like a crouching beast, as
though to spring on her and strangle or tear her; but
she stepped back beyond his spring.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I give you no occasion for this,' she said; 'you speak
and act like a madman.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is you who drive me to act and speak like one,'
he cried.  'You are now mistress of yourself, you have
money—as much as you want; now you will shake me
off.  Now you will desert the man who stood between
you and your fool.  You will go off with him and forget
me.  It shall not be.' He clutched his hands into his
sides.  'It never shall be.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not listen to this.  I will not endure such
words,' she exclaimed.  'Remain here and cool.'  Then
she left the room, and, walking across the pasture to
the landing-place, extended her hand with a smile to
George.  It was a relief to her to be away for a while
from the gloom and savagery of the man to whom she
was bound for life.  In her simplicity and guilelessness
she would not believe that there was any wrong in
meeting the friend of her childhood, her almost brother.
She needed some light on her sad life, and the light
shone from him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My dear Glory,' he said,' I am delighted to see you.
What a colour there is in your cheeks.  Has the prophet
been in his frenzies again?  I fear so.  You must not
allow it.  You should not endure it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How can I help it, George? it is the man's nature
to rave; he has it in his blood.  I almost fear he will
go mad like his poor brother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The sooner the better.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do not say that.  You do not know how dreadful
was the condition of that miserable wretch.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do say it, Glory, dearest!  I say it, because the
sooner you are freed from this tyranny and torture, the
better for both of us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How so?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory, dear! is it true that you have been left a
small fortune?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, it is true.  It seems that there is money in
various securities, the savings of Charles Pettican's life,
and they bring in something like three hundred pounds
a year.  Sometimes it may be less, sometimes perhaps
more.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And is this money absolutely your own?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Entirely.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You may do with it what you like?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, altogether; even Elijah cannot touch it.  I
will give you all if you like, or as much as you like.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I would not touch it without you, Glory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She sighed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, George, George! to think how happy we might
have been!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We may be, Glory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not see how that is possible.  I have no more
any hopes, but it is a great pleasure to me to see you
and to hear you talk.  I think of old days and old
dreams of happiness.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, Glory! with three hundred a year we might
have lived as gentlefolks, doing nothing.  We might
have bought a little house and garden just anywhere, at
the other end of England, in Scotland, or where you
liked, away from all ugly sights and memories.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I had no ugly memories in the old days,' she said
sorrowfully.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I suppose not.  But you have now.  My Glory! how
delightful it would be to cast all the horrible past
away like a bad dream; all the past from when I was
pressed into the service, to now—to drop it all out of
memory as though it never had been, and to take up
the story of life from that interruption.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, George!'  She trembled and gave one great
sob, that shook her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How we should live to one another, live in one
another, and love one another.  Why, Glory! we should
not care for any others to come and disturb us, we
should be so happy——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She covered her face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'On three hundred a year,' he went on.  'That is a
beautiful sum.  I suppose you need not live here on it:
you might live where you liked on the money.  It is
not laid out on land in Wyvenhoe?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, no.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You might take, let us suppose, a cottage by
Plymouth Harbour.  I have been there; it is a lovely
spot, where you would see ships of all sorts sailing by;
and just draw your money and live at ease.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I suppose so.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And nobody there would know you, whence you
came, and what your history.  They would not care to
ask.  That would be a new life, and in it all the past
would be forgotten.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why do you talk like this to me, George?  I cannot
bear it.  You raise pictures before me which never
can exist.  All I want is to live on here in my sorrow
and difficulties, and just now and then to see you and
talk to you, and thus to get refreshed and go back to
my duties again with a lighter heart, and strengthened
to bear my burden.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not understand what you mean by duties,' he
said.  'You have told me more than once that you
have only formally taken Elijah Rebow as a husband,
but that he is nothing to you in reality, you do not
love him, and have no tie to bind you to him save the
farce you went through with him in church.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is another,' said Mehalah in a faint tone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What other?  What other can there be?  You do
not look on him as your husband, do you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No I do not, and I never will.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You do not even wear a wedding ring.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He understood that he was to be regarded by you
in no other light than as one who gave his name to you
in consideration for some service.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That was all.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then I cannot see that you are not free.  You
promised to be my wife, quite as solemnly as you have
promised anything to Elijah, and you made your
agreement with him on the supposition that I was dead.
He knew he was deceiving you, and that I was alive to
claim the fulfilment of your oath to me.  He got your
promise from you under false representations, and it
cannot stand.  You did not know how matters stood,
or you would never have taken it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never, never!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Through all, you say, you have held true to me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Indeed I have, George.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then Glory, my dearest, our course is quite clear.
You are not bound to this man, but you are bound to
me.  Your tie to him is worthless and is snapped;
your tie to me is strong and holds.  I insist on the
fulfilment, I have a right to do so.  I must have you
as my own.  Come away with me.  Come to any part
of England, where you will, where we are not known,
where our names have never been heard, and we will
be properly married in a church, and live together
happily the rest of our lives.  As for your mother, she
is failing fast.  I will wait till her death, or we can
take her away at once with us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, George, George!'  Mehalah's tones were those
of one in acute pain.  She flung herself on the ground
at his feet, and clasped her hands on her brow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He looked at her with some surprise: 'This will be
a change for the better.  You will escape out of darkness
into sunshine, and leave all your miseries in this
hateful marsh behind your back.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George!  George!' she moaned.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah deserves not a thought,' he went on.  'He
has behaved like a villain from beginning to end, and
if he is served out now, no one will pity him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is impossible, George!' exclaimed Mehalah, lifting
herself on her knees and holding her knitted fingers
against her heart.  'It cannot be, George.  It never
can be.  There is another tie that I cannot break.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What tie?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must own it, though it steep me in shame.  It
was I, George, who blinded him, I in mad fear and anger
mingled, not knowing what I did, poured the vitriol
over his eyes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>George De Witt drew back from her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory! how dreadful!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is dreadful, but it was done without premeditation.
He had me in his arms and told me what he had done
to you—' she corrected herself—'what he pretended he
had done to you, and then he tried to kiss me, and in a
moment of loathing and effort to escape I did the deed.
I did not know what was in the bottle.  I did not know
what I laid hold of.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are a dangerous person to deal with, Glory.
I should be sorry to provoke you.  I do not understand
you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I suppose you do not,' she said, with a sob; 'but
you must see this, George.  I have blinded him and
made him a helpless creature dependent on me.  I did
it, and I must atone for it.  I brought him into this
condition, and I must expiate what I did by helping
him to bear the affliction.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He exasperated you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, but think what he is now, a wreck.  I must
tow the wreck into port.  There is no help for it; I
cannot leave him, I have brought this on myself, and I
must bear it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory! what nonsense!  You do not love me or you
would at once come away with me, and leave him to his
fate.  He has richly deserved it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I not love you!' she cried.  'Oh, George! how can
you doubt that I do?  I have suffered for you, dreamed
of you, lived for you.  My world without you is a world
without a sun.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then come with me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot do it.  I have done that which binds me
to Elijah.  I must not leave him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will not.  Hark!'  A burst of merry bells
from West Mersea church tower swept over the water.
'There is a wedding to-day yonder, and the bells are
being pealed in honour of it.  Did the bells peal when
you were married?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They shall when you become mine.  Not those
Mersea bells, but some others where we are not known.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It cannot, it cannot be.  George! do not tempt
and torture me.  I must not leave Elijah.  I have linked
my fate to his by my own mad act, and that cannot be
undone.  Oh, George! if it had not been for that, I might
have listened to you and followed you; for I am not, and
never will be his; but now I cannot desert him in his
darkness and despair.  I could not be happy with you
if I were to leave him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is too bad of you,' said the young man angrily.
'You are to me an incomprehensible girl.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Can we not live on as we are at present, true to each
other yet separated?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, we cannot.  It is not in nature.  I will tell you
what, Glory!  If you do not come away with me and
marry me, I will marry someone else.  There are more
fish in the sea than come out of it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She rose to her feet and stood back, and looked at
him with wide open eyes.  'George, this is a cruel jest.
It should not be uttered.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is no jest, but sober earnest,' he answered sullenly.
'Glory!  I don't see why I should not marry as well as
you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, George!  George! do not speak to me in this
way.  I have been true to you, and you have promised
to be true to me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Conditionally,' he interjected.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You could not do it.  You could not take another
woman to your heart.  George! you talk of
impossibilities.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Indeed!  Do you think that another girl would not
have me?  If so, you are mistaken.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You could not do it,' she persisted.  'If you were
to, it would not be the George I knew and loved and
lost, but another.  The George I knew and loved and
lost was true to me as I to him; he could no more take
another to his heart than can I.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But you have, Glory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have not.  Elijah sits nowhere near my heart.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not believe it.  If he did not, you would shake
him off without another thought and follow me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you not see,' she cried passionately, holding out
both her palms, and trembling with her vehemence,
'that I cannot.  I by my own act have made him helpless,
and would you have me desert him in his helplessness?
I cannot do it.  There is something in here, in
my bosom, I know not what it is, but it will not let
me.  If I were to go against that I should never be at
ease.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are not at ease now.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That would be different.  I have my sorrow now,
but my distress then would be of another sort and
utterly unendurable.  I cannot explain myself.  George! you
ought to understand me.  If I were to say these
words to Elijah he would see through my heart at once,
and all the thoughts in it would be visible to him as
painted figures in a church window.  To you they seem
all broken and jumbled and meaningless.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I tell you again, Glory, I do not understand you.
Perhaps it is as well that we should live apart.  I
hate to have a knot in my hands I can't untie.  If
Elijah understands you, keep to him.  I shall look for
a mate elsewhere.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'George!' she said plaintively, 'You are angry
and offended.  I am sorry for it.  I will do anything
for you.  True to you I must and will remain, but
I will not leave Elijah and follow you.  I could not
do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Very well then, I shall look for a wife elsewhere.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You cannot do it,' she said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Can I not?' echoed George De Witt with a laugh;
'I rather believe there is a nice girl at Mersea who
only wants to be asked to jump into my arms.  It seems
to me that I owe her reparation for your treatment of
her once on my boat.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now, Glory! let us understand one another.  If
you will run off with me—and I see nothing but some
silly sentiment to hinder you—then we will be married
and live happily together on your little fortune and my
pension and what I can pick up.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you will not, why then, I shall go straight from
here to Phoebe Musset, and ask her to be my wife;
and you may take my word for it that in three weeks
the bells that are now pealing from Mersea tower will
be pealing again for us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You could not do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Indeed I will.  I shall go direct to her.  My mother
wishes it and I know that Phoebe is ready with her
yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You can take her, </span><em class="italics">her</em><span>, to your heart?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Delighted to do so.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then, George!  I never knew you, I never understood you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I dare say not, no more than I can understand you.
Once again, will you come with me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, never.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You never loved me.  I shall go to Phoebe and
have done with Glory.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She lifted her hands to heaven, pressed them to her
heart, and then ran with extended arms back to Red
Hall, stumbling and recovering herself, and fluttering
on, still with arms outstretched, like a wounded bird
trying to rise but unable, seeking a covert where it may
hide its head and die.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>She ran on.  Red Hall was before her.  The sun had
set, and scarlet, amber, and amethyst were the tints
of the sky, blotted by the great bulk of the old house
standing up alone against the horizon.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She ran on, and the wedding bells of Mersea steeple
chanted joyously in the summer evening air, and the
notes flew over the flats like melodious wildfowl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She ran up the steps, in at the door of the hall,
where sat Elijah with his finger feeling the inscription
on the chimney-piece, with the red light glaring through
the western window on his forehead, staining it crimson.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She cast herself at his feet; she placed her elbows
on his knees, and laid her head upon them.  Dimly he
saw the scarlet cap like a broken poppy droop and fall
before him, he put out his hand and it rested upon it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She had come to him, to the only heart that was
constant, that was not to be shaken and moved from its
anchorage; to the only soul that answered to her own,
to the only mind that read her thoughts.  The George
of her fancy, the ideal of truth and steadfastness, was
dissolved, and had disappeared leaving a mean vulgar
object behind from which she shrank.  To him whom
she had hated, with whom she had fought and against
whom she had stiffened her back, she now flew as her
only support, her only anchorage.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She could not speak, her thoughts chased through
her head in wild disorder like the clouds when there
are cross currents in the sky.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now and then a spasmodic sob broke from her and
shook her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is the matter, Mehalah?  Where have you been?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not answer.  She could not.  She was
choking.  Perhaps she did not hear him, or hearing did
not understand the import of his words.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She saw only the falling to pieces into dust of an
idol.  Better had George died, and she had lived on
looking upon him as her ideal of manhood, noble,
straightforward, truthful, constant.  She would have
been content to drudge on in her weary life at Red
Hall and would have borne Elijah's humours and her
mother's fretfulness, without a hope herself, if only she
might still have maintained intact her image of all
that was honourable and steadfast.  She could not bear
the revulsion of feeling.  She was like a religionist
who, on lifting the purple veil of the sanctuary, has
found his God, before whom he had offered libations
and prayers, to be some grovelling beast.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where have you been?' again asked Elijah placing
his hands on her shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She raised her head, and gasped for breath, she
essayed to speak but could not.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why do you not answer me?' he asked, not with
fierceness in his tone, but with iron resolve.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah!' he said firmly, solemnly.  'There have
passed many days since George De Witt returned, and
since Charles Pettican's bequest has rendered you
independent of me.  I have waited, and wanted to hold
you, as I hold you now, firmly, fast in my strong hands.
You feel them on your shoulders.  They shall never let
go.  Now that I hold I shall hold fast.  Mehalah! we
have old scores to wipe out.  Days and weeks of blind
agony in me, hours, days of horrible internal torture
whilst George De Witt has been here.  I hold you now
and all must now be made square between us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She tried to raise her hands, but he held her
shoulders so tightly she could not move them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah!' she said, 'do with me what you will.  It
is all one to me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where have you been? with whom have you been?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have been with him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I knew it.  You shall never be with him again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She sighed.  She knew that he spoke truly.  Never
could she see him again, in the old light; she never
could meet him again on the old footing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah!' he went on, and his hands shook, and
shook her; 'I have loved you; but now I hate and
love you at the same time.  You have caused me to
suffer tortures, the like of which I could not suppose it
possible any man could have endured, and have lived.
You little knew and less cared what I endured in my
eyes when they were burnt out.  You little know and
less care what I have endured in my soul since George
De Witt has been back.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah,' she said raising her heavy head, 'let me
speak.  George——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No never,' he interrupted, 'never shall you utter
his name again.'  He covered her mouth with his
hand.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, I could not bear it,' he went on.  'Mehalah! your
heart has never been mine, and I will not endure
to be longer without it.  Could you come to my breast
and let my arms lap round you and our hearts beat
against each other's bosom, and glue your lips to mine?
No, no,' he answered himself.  'Not now, I cannot
expect it.  He has stood in my path, he has risen out
of the waters to part us.  Whilst we are on the earth
we cannot be united, because he intercepts the current
which runs from my heart to yours, and from yours to
mine.  Although he might be far away, a thousand
miles distant, yet the tide of your affection would set
to him.  The moon they tell us is some hundreds of
thousands of miles from the ocean, and yet the water
throbs and rises, and falls and retreats responsive to the
impulse of the moon, because moon and earth are both
in one sphere.  As long as you and he are together in
one orb, there is no peace for me, your love will never
flow to me and dance and sparkle about me.  I must look
elsewhere for peace, elsewhere for union, without which
there is no peace.  Lift up your head, Mehalah!  Why
is it resting thus heavily on my knee?  I do not know
what has come over you.  Yes—' he said suddenly, in a
louder tone, 'Yes I do know what it is.  It is the
shadow of the cloud, the scent before the rain.  You
have crept to me, you have cast yourself at my feet,
you have leaned your head on my knee, you lift your
arms to my heart, for the consummation is at hand.
Mehalah!  Do you understand me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.  We two understand each other, and none
others can.  Now, Mehalah!  Glory! you shall not
escape me.  Glory! will you kiss me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He put his hand to her head, and felt it shaken in
the negative.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No.  I did not suppose you would.  You would
kiss George, but not me; but you never shall belong
to another but me.  Hold up your face, Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He lifted it with one hand, and peered at it through
the haze that ever attended him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory!' he said.  'Will you swear to me, if I let
you go one minute, that you will place yourself here,
at my feet, in my hands, as you lie now?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is dark, is it not?  I can see nothing, not your
flaming cap.  I will let you go.  I can trust your
lightest word.  Go and kindle me a candle.'  He
relaxed his grasp, and she staggered to her feet, and
dully, in a dream obeyed.  There was a candle on the
chimney-piece, she took it to the hearth in the kitchen
and lighted it there.  The charwoman was gone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go upstairs,' he said.  'There has been no sound
in the house this hour.  Go and kiss your mother and
come back.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She obeyed again, and crept lifelessly up the stairs;
in another moment he heard a low long muffled wail.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He listened.  She did not return.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah!' he called.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He waited a minute and then called again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She came down bearing the light.  He did not see,
but the candle glittered in tears rolling down her cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come to your place,' he ordered.  'Remember you swore.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She threw herself at his feet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My mother! my mother!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She is dead,' said Elijah.  'I knew it.  I heard
her feebly cry for you, an hour ago, and I crept upstairs,
and I listened by her bed, and held my hand to her heart
till it ceased.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah did not speak, her frame shook with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He took the candle, raised her face with his hand
under the chin and held the light close to it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot see much,' he said; 'I can see scarce anything
of the dear face, of the great brown eyes I loved
so well, I can see only something flame there.  That is
the cap.'  He took it off and passed his hand through
her rich hair.  'I can see, I think I can see, the flicker
of the candle flame in the eyes.  I can see the mouth,
that mouth I have never touched, but I see it only as a
red evening cloud across the sky.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let me go!' she wailed.  'My mother! my mother!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We will go together to her,' he answered; 'stay one
moment.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He put down the candle, and once more laid his
hand on her head, and now he pressed it back with his
left hand.  Did she see in the dull eyes a gathering
moisture, the rising of a tide?  A tear ran down each
of his rugged cheeks.  Then he suddenly rose, and he
struck her full in the forehead with his iron fist, heavy
as a sledge hammer.  She dropped in a heap on the
floor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory! my own, own Glory!' he cried, and listened.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was no answer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory! my love! my pride! my second self! my double!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He caught her up, and she hung across his knee.
He held his ear to her mouth and hearkened.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh Glory! my own! my own!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He stretched his hand above the mantelpiece and
plucked down the chain and padlock; he secured the
key.  Then he cast the chain over his arm and drew
the inanimate girl to him and held her in his firm
grasp, and lifted her over his shoulder, and felt his way
out at the door and down the steps.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>No one was in the yard.  No one on the pasture.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The sun had set some time, but there was blood and
fire on the horizon, clouds seamed with flame, and
streaks of burning crimson.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He cautiously descended the stairs, and crossing
the yard, made his way over the pasture to the
landing place.  He knew the path well.  He could
have trod it in the darkest night without error.  He
came to the sea-wall, and there he laid Mehalah, whilst
he groped for his boat, and unloosed the rope that
attached it to the shore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He returned, and took up the still unconscious girl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He felt her feeble breath on his cheek as he carried
her, but he did not see the spot of returning colour in
her face.  He was eager, and hasty.  He knew no delay,
but pressed on.  He carried her into the boat and
took his oars and began to row, with her lying in the
bottom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The tide was running out.  His instinct guided him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The bells of Mersea tower were dancing a merry peal.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The windows of the 'Leather Bottle' were lighted
up, and the topers were drinking prosperity to the
married pair.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>George De Witt was making his way to the Mussets,
little conscious that Mehalah was lying in a boat,
stunned, and being carried out seaward.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently Elijah felt sure by the fresher breeze and
increased motion that he was out cf the fleet in deep
water.  Then he quietly shipped his oars.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He lifted Mehalah, and drew her into his arms and
laid her against his heart.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My Glory! my own dearest! my only one!' he
moaned.  'I could not help it.  You would have left
me had I not done this.  There was no other way out
of the tangle, there was no other path into the light.
Glory! we were created for each other, but a perverse
fortune has separated your heart from mine here.  We
shall meet and unite in another world.  We must do so,
we were born for each other.  Glory!  Glory!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She stirred and opened her eyes, and drew a long
breath.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Are you waking, Glory?' he asked.  'Hark, hark! the
marriage bells are ringing, ringing, ringing, for you
and me.  Now Glory! now only is our marriage! now
only, locked together, shall we find rest.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He took the iron chain, and wound it round her and
him, tying them together tight, and then he fastened
the padlock and flung the key into the sea.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Once I turned the key in the lock carelessly, and
he who was bound by this chain escaped.  I have fastened
it firmly now, it will not fall apart for all eternity.
Now Glory!  Now we are bound together for everlasting.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She sighed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do you hear me?' he asked.  'It is well.  Glory! one
kiss?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He put down his hand into the bottom of the boat,
and drew out the plug, and tossed it overboard.  At
once the cold sea-water rushed in and overflowed his
feet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory!' he cried, and he folded her to his heart, and
fastened his lips fiercely, ravenously to hers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He felt her heart throb, faintly indeed, but really.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Merrily pealed the musical bells.  Cans of ale had
been supplied the ringers, and they dashed the ropes
about in a fever of intoxication and sympathy.  Joy to
the wedded pair!  Long life and close union and
happiness without end!  The topers at the 'Leather Bottle'
brimmed their pewter mugs and drank the toast with
three cheers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The water boiled up, through the plughole, and the
boat sank deeper.  Life was beginning to return to
Mehalah, but she neither saw nor knew aught.  Her
eyes were open and turned seaward, to the far away
horizon, and Elijah relaxed his hold one instant.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah!' she suddenly exclaimed, 'How cold!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Glory!  Glory!  It is fire!  We are one!'
The bells pealed over the rolling sea—no boat was
on it, only a sea-mew skimming and crying.</span></p>
