<p class="pfirst"><span>A month passed.  Mrs. Sharland recovered, as far as
recovery was possible to one of her age and enfeebled
constitution, much shaken by the events of the night
that saw the destruction of her home and the abrasion
of the ear and tail of her biscuit-china poodle.  After
remaining in bed for more than a week, Mehalah almost
by force obliged her to get up and descend.  When once
she had taken this step and found that her leather
high-backed chair was before the fire in the hall, she showed
no further desire to spend her days upstairs.  Her life
resumed the old course it had run at the Ray, but she
sat more by the fire, and did less in the house than
formerly.  She devolved most of the domestic work on
her daughter.  That she had declined in strength of
late was obvious.  Old people will go on from year to
year without any visible alteration, till some shock, or
change in their surroundings takes place, when they
drop perceptibly a stage, and from that moment
declension becomes rapid.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland was unmistakably contented with her
position at Red Hall.  She enjoyed comforts which
were not hers at the Ray.  She saw more people, some
gossip reached her ears.  There was a village, Salcotty
within two miles, and the small talk of a village will
overflow its bounds, and dribble into every house in its
neighbourhood.  Every little parish throws up its
coarse crop of vulgar tittle-tattle, on which the
inhabitants feed, and which is exactly adapted to their mental
digestion.  Human characters as well as skins are
subject to parasitic attacks, but human beings are the
vermin which burrow their heads into, and blow themselves
out on the blood of moral life.  There are certain
creatures which will lie shrivelled up on their backs,
and endure flood and frost and burning sun, without
its killing them, with suspended animation, till the
animal on which they feed chances to come that
way, when they leap into activity and voracity at
once.  Mrs. Sharland had been laid aside on the
Ray, without neighbours, and therefore without matter
of interest and objects of attack.  She was now within
leaping, lancing, and sucking distance of fresh life, and
she rejoiced in renewed vigour, not of body, but of
mind, if mind that can be called which has neither
thought nor instinct, but only a certain gravitation
which sets the tongue in motion.  The brain of the
rustic is as unlike the brain of the man of culture
as the maggot is unlike the butterfly; the one is the
larva of the other.  They feed, live, move in different
spheres; one chews cabbage, the other sips honey; one
crawls on the earth, the other flies above it; one is
clumsy in all its motions, the other agile; one is carnal,
the other is spiritual.  And yet—wondrous thought! the
one is the parent of the other.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah had a great deal to do, and that work of
a sort she had not been much engaged on at the Ray.
No female hand had been employed at Red Hall since
the death of Elijah's mother, and everything was accordingly
falling out of repair and into disorder.  She saw
nothing of Rebow except at meals, and not always then,
for he was often away with beasts at market, or at sales
making purchases.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The rich marshes of Red Hall were unrivalled for
the grazing of cattle, and the rearing of young stock.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As Mehalah was well occupied, her mind was taken
off from herself, and she was for a while satisfied with
her position.  Rebow had not spoken to her in the
manner she so disliked, and she had small occasion to
speak with the men.  Her mother, on the contrary,
seized every occasion to entangle them in talk, or to
initiate a conversation with Rebow.  He maintained
a surly deference towards her, and condescended at
times to answer her queries and allow himself to be
drawn into talk by the old woman.  When that was the
case, Mehalah found excuse to leave the room and
engage herself in the kitchen or among the cows.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Abraham Dowsing saw much less of her than formerly.
The old man, with all his sulky humour and selfish
greed, had got a liking for the girl.  He was much at
the Ray, but often about Red Hall, where he got his food.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If he went after the sheep for the day, Mehalah provided
him with 'baggings,' provision during his absence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Lambing time was at hand, when he would be away
for some weeks, returning only occasionally.  Mehalah
noticed that the shepherd hesitated each time he
received his food, as though he desired to speak to her,
but put off the occasion.  At last, one day at the
beginning of February, when he was about to depart for the
Ray, and would be absent some days, he said to her in
a low dissatisfied tone, 'I suppose, when I come back
after the lambing, you'll have been to church with him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you mean?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do I mean?' repeated Abraham, 'I mean
what I say.  I ain't one of those that says one thing
and means another.  Nobody can accuse me of that.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not understand you, Abraham.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There's none so dull as them that won't take,' he
pursued.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't hold, myself, that much good comes
of going to church with a man, except this, that you
fasten him, and he can't cast you off when he's tired
of you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah flushed up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Abraham,' she said angrily, 'I will not allow you
to speak thus to me.  I understand you now, and wish
I did not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh! you do take at last!  That's well.  I'd act
on it if I was you.  A man, you see, don't make no
odds of taking up with a girl, and then when he's had
a bit of her tongue and temper, he thinks he'd as lief
be without her, and pick up another.  He'd ring a
whole change on the bells, he would, if it warn't for
churches.  That is my doctrine.  Churches was built,
and parsons were made, for tying up of men, and the
girls are fools who let the men make up to them, and
don't seize the opportunity to tie them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Abraham, enough of this.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is no odds to me.  I don't care so long as I has
my wittles and my wage.  Only I'd rather see you
mistress here than another.  I'd get my wittles more
regular and better, because you know me and my likings,
and a new one wouldn't.  That's all.  Every man for
himself, is my doctrine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I forbid this for once and all.  I am servant on
wage here just as you are; I am that, and I shall never
be anything else.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, there you think different from most folks.  You
don't think according to your interests; and mistress,
let me tell you, you don't talk as does the master.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He went away mumbling something about it being
no concern of his, and if some people did not know how
to eat their bread and butter when they had it in their
hands it was no odds to him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah was hurt and incensed.  She went to her
mother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother,' she said, 'when will you be able to move?
I shall look out for a situation elsewhere.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What, my dear child!  Move from here, where I
am so comfortable!  You can not.  Elijah won't hear
of it.  He told me so.  He told me you was to remain
here, and I should spend the rest of my days here in
quiet.  It is a very pleasant place, and more in the
world than was the Ray.  I am better off here than I
was there.  Now we get everything for nothing, we
don't lay out a penny, and you get wage beside.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, Abraham has been speaking to me.  He
has hinted, what I do not like, that I ought to marry
Elijah——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'So you ought,' said the widow.  'Elijah, I am
sure, is willing.  It is what he has been wishing and
hoping for all along, but you have been so stubborn and
set against him.  After all he has done for us you might
yield a bit.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will never marry him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't say that.  You will do anything to secure a
comfortable home for me.  It may not be long that I
may have to trouble you,—I know you look on me as a
trouble, I know that but for me you would feel free,
and go away into the world.  You think me a burden
on you, because I can do nothing: you are young and
lusty.  But I bore with you, Mehalah, when you was
young and feeble, and I laid by for you money that
would have been very acceptable to me, and bought me
many little comforts that I forbore, to save for
you——'  The old woman with low cunning had discovered
the thread to touch, to move her daughter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Say no more, say not another word, mother,'
exclaimed Mehalah.  'You know that I never, never will
forsake you, that you are more to me a thousand times
than my own life.  But there is one thing I never will
do for you.  I never will marry Elijah.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am afraid, Mehalah, that folks will talk.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I fear so too, but they have no occasion.  I will
show them that.  I will find a situation elsewhere.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You shall not, Mehalah!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must, mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She thought for some time what she should do, and
then put on her bonnet, and walked into Salcott.  She
had not been into the village since her arrival at Red Hall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Salcott is a small village of old cottages at the head
of a creek that opens out of the Blackwater.  It has a
church with a handsome tower built of flints, but with
no chancel.  Within a bowshot, across the creek,
connected with it by a bridge, is Virley church, a small
hunchbacked edifice in the last stages of dilapidation,
in a graveyard unhedged, unwalled; the church is
scrambled over by ivy, with lattice windows bulged in
by the violence of the gales, and a bellcot leaning on
one side like a drunkard.  Near this decaying church
is a gabled farm, and this and a cottage form Virley
village.  The principal population congregates at
Salcott, across the wooden bridge, and consisted—a
hundred years ago—of labourers, and men more or less
engaged in the contraband trade.  Every house had its
shed and stable, where was a donkey and cart, to be let
on occasion to carry smuggled goods inland.  At the
end of the village stands a low tavern, the Rising Sun,
a mass of gables; part of it, the tavern drinking-room,
is only one storey high, but the rest is a jumble of roofs
and lean-to buildings, chimneys, and ovens, a miracle
of picturesqueness.  Mehalah walked into the bar, and
found there the landlady alone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have come here, mistress,' she said abruptly, 'in
search of work.  I am strong and handy, and will do
as much as a man.  I will serve you faithfully and well
if you will engage me.  I have an infirm mother who
must be lodged somewhere, so I ask for small wage.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who are you?  Where do you come from?' asked
the landlady eyeing her with surprise.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My name is Mehalah Sharland.  I lived on the
Ray till the house was burned down.  Since then I have
been at Red Hall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh!' exclaimed the woman, her countenance
falling.  'You are the young woman, are you, that I
heard tell of?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am the young woman now in service there, but
wanting to go and work elsewhere.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I've heard tell of you,' said the landlady dryly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What have you heard of me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The woman looked knowingly at her, and smiled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Pray what does Master Rebow say to your leaving
him?  You and he have fallen out, have you?' said the
hostess knowingly.  'You'll come together all the faster
for it.  There's nothing like a good breeze for running
a cargo in.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Can you give me work?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I dursn't do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you need of anyone now?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well,' with a cough, 'if Master Rebow were agreeable,
I might find such a girl as you wery handy about
the house.  I've lost the last girl I had; she's took
with the small-pox.  You could have her bed, and her
work, and her wage, and welcome.  But unless the
master gave his consent,' she began to dust the table,
'I dursn't do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Is he your landlord?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, he is not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then why need you doubt about taking me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Because Rebow wouldn't allow of it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He could not stop me.  I am not engaged to him
for any time.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I dursn't do it.  How long have you been with
Rebow?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A little more than a month.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You've never gone against him perhaps.  If you
had, you wouldn't ask me the reason why I dursn't
stand in his way.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah considered.  She had opposed Elijah from
the very beginning.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There's no one would dare to do it,' continued the
landlady.  'If you want to get from Master Rebow,
you must go farther inland; but I doubt if you'll
escape him.  However,' and she tossed her head, 'you
only want to make him fast.  If a girl gives way at
once, she's cheap.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You mistake me, you altogether mistake me,' said
Mehalah indignantly.  'I will not remain in his house
any longer; I must and I will go elsewhere.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If Elijah Rebow was to take the purse out of my
pocket, or the bed from under me, if he was to take
my daughter from my side, I dursn't say nay.  If you
think to escape against the will of the master, you are
mistaken.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I shall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look here,' said the landlady; 'take my advice
and go back and be mum.  I won't say another word
with you, lest I get into trouble.'  She turned and left
the bar.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah went out, more determined than ever to
break away from Red Hall, whether her mother desired
it or not.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She crossed the creaking rude wooden bridge to
Virley.  The churchyard and the farmyard seemed all
one.  The pigs were rooting at the graves.  A cow was
lying in the porch.  An old willow drooped over a
stagnant pool beneath the chancel window.  Shed
roof-tiles and willow leaves lay mouldering together on the
edge of the pond.  The church of timber and brick,
put up anyhow on older stone foundations, had warped
and cracked; the windows leaned, fungus growths
sprouted about the bases of the timbers.  Every rib
showed in the roof as on the side of a horse led to the
knackers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The farm was but little more prosperous in appearance
than the church.  Patched windows and broken
railings showed a state of decline.  Mehalah walked
into the yard, where she saw a man carrying a pitchfork.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who is the master here?' she asked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Is there a mistress?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.  What have you to say to her?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah told her story as she had told it to the
landlady of the Rising Sun.  'I will work for my keep
and that of my mother, and work harder than any man
on your farm.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where do you come from?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Red Hall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh!' said the farmer, with a whistle, 'Rebow's girl, eh?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am working for him now.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Working for him, come now that's fine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am working for him,' repeated Mehalah with
clouding brow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And you want to come here.  You think my
missus would let you, do you?  Now tell me, what put
you on to coming to me?  Has Elijah picked a quarrel
with me, that he sends you here?  Does he want
occasion against me?  Do you think I want to run any
risks with my barns and my cattle and my life?  No,
thank you.  I dursn't do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Tell me, where can I find work?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You must go out of the reach of Rebow's arm, if
you find it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You won't give me any?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He shook his head.  'For my life, I dursn't do it.'  He
laughed and put out his hand to chuck her under
the chin, she struck his fingers up with her fist.
'There ain't a better judge of beasts in all the marshes
than Rebow, nor in horse-flesh neither.  You ain't a
bad bit of meat neither.  I approve his taste.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah wrenched the pitchfork out of his hand.
Her eyes flamed.  She would have struck him; but was
suddenly assailed from behind by the farmer's wife.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now then, hussy, what are you up to?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl could not answer; her anger choked the
words in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She's that wench of Rebow's, you know,' said the
farmer.  'I guess it is cat and dog in that house.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Get you gone,' shouted the woman, 'go out of my
premises, hussy!  I don't want my place to be frequented
by such as you.  Get you gone at once, or I will loose
the mastiff.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah retired with bowed head, and her arms
folded on her bosom.  She halted on the bridge, and
kicked fragments of frozen earth and gravel into the
water.  A woman going by looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is the parson?' asked Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yonder, you go over the marsh by the hill with
the windmill on it, and you come to a road, you'll find
a blacksmith's shop, and you must ask there.  He's the
curate, there's no rector hereabouts.  They keep away
because of the ague.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah cross the fen indicated, passed beside the
windmill and the blacksmith's shop, and found the
cottage occupied by the curate, a poor man, married
to a woman of a low class, with a family of fourteen
children, packed in the house wherever they could be
stowed away.  The curate was a crushed man, his ideas
stunned in his head by the uproar in which he dwelt.
His old scholarship remained to him in his brain like
fossils in the chalk, to be picked ont, dead morsels.
There was nothing living in the petrified white matter
that filled his skull.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah knocked at the door.  The parson opened
it, and admitted her into his kitchen.  As soon as the
wife heard a female voice, she rushed out of the back
kitchen with her arms covered with soap suds, and stood
in the door.  A little-minded woman, she lived on her
jealousy, and would never allow her husband to speak
with another woman if she could help it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you want, my dear?' asked the curate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ahem!' coughed the wife.  'Dear, indeed!  Pray
who are you, miss?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah explained that she sought work, and hoped
that the parson would be able to recommend her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You don't, you don't——' faltered he.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You don't suppose I'd take you on here,' said the
parson's wife.  'You're too young by twenty years.  I
don't approve of young women; they don't make good
servants.  I like a staid matronly person of forty to
fifty, that one can trust, and won't be gadding after
boys or——' she shook her suds at her husband.  'But
I don't at present want any servant.  We are full.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We don't keep any,' said the pastor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Edward! don't demean us, we do keep
servants—occasionally.  You know we do, Edward.  Mrs. Cutts
comes in to scour out and clean up of a Saturday.
You forget that.  We pay her ninepence.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who are you, my dear—I mean, young woman?'
asked the curate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, who are you?' said his better half.  'We
must know more of you before we can recommend you
among our friends.  Our friends are very select, and
keep quite a better sort of servants, they don't pick up
anybody, they take so to speak the cream, the very
purest quality.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah gave the required information.  Mrs. Rabbit
bridled and blew bubbles.  The Reverend Mr. Rabbit
became depressed, yet made an effort to
be confidential.  'You'd better—you'd better marry
him,' he hinted.  'It would be a satisfaction on all
sides.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is that?  What did you say, Edward?  No
whisperings in my house, if you please.  My house is
respectable, I hope, though it mayn't be a lordly mansion.
I do drive a conweyance,' she said, 'I hire the
blacksmith's donkey-cart when I go out to make my calls,
and drop my cards.  So I leave you to infer if I'm not
respectable.  And Miss—Miss—Miss—' with a giggle
and a curtsey, 'when may I have the felicity of calling
on you at Red Hall, and of learning how respectable
that establishment has become?  There's room for
improvement,' she said, tossing her nose.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At that moment a rush, a roar, an avalanche down
the narrow stairs, steep as a ladder.  In a heap came
the whole fourteen, the oldest foremost, the youngest in
the rear.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We've got him, we're going to drown him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is it?' feebly enquired the father, putting
his hands to his ears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We'll hold him to the fire and pop his little eyes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, they're too small.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Into the water-butt with him!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A yell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He's bitten me.  Drown him!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is it?' shouted the mother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A bat.  Tommy found him in the roof.  We're
going to put him in the butt, and see if he can
swim.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The whole torrent swept and swirled round Mehalah,
and carried her to the front door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The curate stole out after her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My good girl,' he whispered, 'botch it up.  Marry.
Most marriages hereabouts are botches.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Edward!' shouted Mrs. Rabbit, 'come in, no sneaking
outside after lasses.  Come back at once.  Always
wanting a last word with suspicious characters.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Marry!' was the pastor's last word, as he was drawn
back by two soapy hands applied to his coat tails, and
the door was slammed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah walked away fast from the yelping throng
of children congregated about the water-butt, watching
the struggles of the expiring bat.  She took the road
before her, and saw that it led to Peldon, the leaning
tower of which stood on a hill that had formed the
northern horizon from the Ray.  There was a nice farm
by the roadside, and she went there, and was met with
excuses.  The time was not one when a girl could be
engaged.  There was no work to be done in the winter.
The early spring was coming on, she urged, and she would
labour in the fields like a man.  Then the sick mother
was mentioned as an insuperable objection.  'We can't
have any old weakly person here on the premises,' said
the farmer's wife.  'You see if she was to die, you've
no money, and we should be put to the expense of the
burying; anyhow there'd be the inconvenience of a
corpse in the house.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah went on; and now a hope dawned in her.
Another two miles would bring her to the Rose, the old
inn that stood not far from the Strood.  There she was
known, and there she was sure, if possible, she would be
accommodated and given work.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She walked forward with raised head, the dark cloud
that had brooded on her brow began to rise, the bands
about her heart that had been contracting gave way a
little.  There was the inn, an old-fashioned house, with
a vine scrambling over the red tile roof, and an ancient
standard sign before the door, on the green, bearing a
rose, painted the size of a gigantic turnip.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah walked into the bar.  The merry landlord
and his wife greeted her with delight, with many shakes
of the hands, and much condolence over the disasters that
had befallen her and her mother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, my dear,' said the landlady, confidentially,
'you're well out of it, if you come here.  To be sure
we'll take you in, and I dare say we'll find you work;
bring your mother also.  It ain't right for a handsome
wench like you to be living all along of a lone man in
his farm.  Folks talk.  They have talked, and said a
deal of things.  But you come here.  What day may
we expect you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must bring my mother by water.  The tide will
not suit for a week.  It must be by day, my mother
cannot come in the boat if there be much rain; and we
shall not be able to come—at least there will be a
difficulty in getting away—should Rebow be at home.
Expect us some day when the weather is favourable and
there be an afternoon tide.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will be sure to come?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sure.'</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Mehalah's heart was lighter now than it had been for
many a week.  She had secured her object.  She could
be out of the toils of Rebow, away from his hateful
presence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She had worked hard and conscientiously at Red
Hall, and felt that she had to some extent cancelled
the obligation he had laid on her.  Her proud spirit,
lately crushed, began to arise; her head was lifted
instead of being bowed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow remarked the change in her, and was satisfied
either that she had reconciled herself to her position,
or that she meditated something which he did not
understand.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland did not share in her daughter's
exultation.  She grumbled and protested.  She was
very comfortable at Red Hall, she was sure Elijah had
been exceedingly kind to them.  They had wanted
nothing.  The house was much better than the old
ramshackle Ray, and their position in it superior to
any they could aspire to at the Rose.  This was a hint
to Mehalah, but the girl refused to take it.  As for
Elijah, what was there to object to in him?  He was
well off, very well off, a prosperous man, who spent
nothing on himself, and turned over a great deal of
money in the year.  He was not very young, but he
was a man who had seen the world and was in his prime
of strength and intelligence.  Mrs. Sharland thought
that they could not do better than settle at the Red
Hall and make it their home for life, and that Mehalah
should put her foolish fancies in her pocket and make
the best of what offered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But Mehalah's determination bore down all opposition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>St. Valentine's Day shone bright with a promise of
spring.  The grey owls were beginning to build in the
hayrick, the catkins were timidly swelling on the nut
bushes; in the ooze the glasswort shot up like little
spikes of vitriol-green glass.  A soft air full of wooing
swept over the flats.  The sun was hot.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The tide flowed at noon, and Elijah was absent.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah, deaf to her mother's remonstrances, removed
some of their needful articles to the boat, and at
last led her mother, well wrapped up, to the skiff.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When the girl had cast loose, and was rowing on
the sparkling water, her heart danced and twinkled
with the wavelets; there was a return of spring to her
weary spirit, and the good and generous seeds in her
uncultivated soul swelled and promised to shoot.  She
was proud to think that she had carried her point, that
in spite of Rebow, she had established her freedom,
that her will had proved its power of resistance.  She
even sang as she rowed, she,—whose song had been
hushed since the disappearance of George.  She had
not forgotten him, and cast away her grief at his loss,
but the recoil from the bondage and moral depression
of Red Hall filled her with transient exultation and
joyousness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The row was long.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'O mother!' she said, as she passed under the Ray
hill, 'I must indeed run up and look at the place.  I
cannot go by.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Do as you will,' said Mrs. Sharland.  'I cannot
control you.  I don't pretend to.  My wishes and my
feelings are nothing to you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah did not notice this peevish remark, she
was accustomed to her mother's fretfulness.  She threw
the little anchor on the gravel at the 'hard,' and jumped
on shore.  She ascended the hill and stood by the
scorched black patch which marked her old home.
The house had burned to the last stick, leaving two
brick chimneys standing gauntly alone.  There was the
old hearth at which she had so often crouched, bare,
cold, and open.  A few bricks had been blown from the
top of the chimney, but otherwise it was intact.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As she stood looking sadly on the relics, Abraham
Dowsing came up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What are you doing here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have come away from Red Hall, Abraham,' she
said gaily, 'I do not think I have been so happy for
many a day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'When are you going back?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who then is to prepare me my wittles?' he asked
sullenly.  'I ain't going to be put off with anything.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not know, Abraham.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But I must know.  Now go back again, and don't
do what's wrong and foolish.  You ought to be there,
and mistress there too.  Then all will run smooth, and
I'll get my wittles as I like them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You need not speak of that, Abraham, I shall
never return to Red Hall.  I have quitted it and I
hope have seen the last of the hateful house and its
still more hateful master.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I wonder,' mused the shepherd, 'whether I could
arrange with Rebow to get my wittles from the Rose.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is where I am going to.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh!' his face lightened, 'then I don't mind.  Do
what you think best.'  His face darkened again.  'But
I doubt whether the master will keep me on when you
have left.  I reckon he only takes me because of you;
he thinks you wouldn't like it, if I was to be turned
adrift.  No.  You had better go back to Red Hall.
Make yourself as comfortable as you can.  That's my
doctrine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently the old man asked, 'I say, does the master
know you have left?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, Abraham.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Are you sure?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I never told him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Did your mother know you had made up your
mind to leave?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, I told her so a week ago.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And you suppose she has kept her mouth shut?
She couldn't do it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If Elijah had suspected we were going to-day,' said
Mehalah, 'I do not think he would have left home; he
would have endeavoured to prevent me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Perhaps.  But he's deep.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Good day, Abraham!'  She waved him a farewell
with a smile.  She knew, and made allowance for the
humours of the old man.  In a moment she was again
by her mother, at the oar, and speeding with the flowing
tide up the Rhyn to the 'hard' at its head belonging
to the Rose Inn.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you brought the toad-jug with you, Mehalah?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Nor the china dogs?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is of no use, I will not live at the Rose.  I will
not get out of the boat.  I must have all my property
about me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will fetch the other things away.  When you
are housed safely, then I shall not care.  I will go back
and bring away all our goods.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are so rough.  I won't let anyone handle the
china but myself.  Last time the poodles were moved,
you know one lost a ear and a bit of its tail.  There
is no one fit to touch such things but me.  Those
rough-handed fellows, Jim and Joe, what do they
know of the value of those dogs?  You will promise
me, Mehalah, to be gentle with them.  Put them in
the foot of a pair of stockings and wrap the legs round
them, and then perhaps they will travel.  I wouldn't
have them lose any more of their precious persons,—no,
not for worlds,—not for worlds.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will take heed, mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And mind and stuff my old nightcap,—the dirty
one, I mean—and my bedsocks into the toad-jug, then
it won't break.  You'll promise me that, won't you; if
that were injured, I'd as soon die as see it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will use the utmost precaution with it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then there are the soup plates, of Lowestoft.  I
had them of my father, and he had them of his
grandmother; there's a dozen of them, and not a chip or a
crack.  True beauties as ever you saw, I think you'd
best put them in the folds of some of my linen.  Put
them between the sheets, wide apart, in the spruce
hutch.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'All right, mother; now hold hard, here we are.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The boat grated on the bottom, and then it was
drawn up by a firm hand.  Mehalah looked round and
started.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah and two other men were there.  Elijah had
stepped into the water, and pulled the boat ashore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Here we are, Glory!' he said, 'waiting ready for
you.  The sheriff's officer with his warrant, all ready.
You haven't kept us waiting long.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is that?  What is that?' screamed Mrs. Sharland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Step out, Glory! step out, mistress!' said Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is the meaning of this?' asked Mehalah, a
cloud suddenly darkening her sky and quenching the
joy of her heart.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I've a warrant against you, madam,' said the man
who stood by Rebow.  'Please to read it.'  He held it
out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is this?' screamed Mrs. Sharland, rising in
the boat and staggering forwards.  Mehalah helped
her on shore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is what it is,' answered Rebow.  'You and
Glory there are my tenants for the Ray.  The farm is
mine, with the marshes and the saltings.  I gave eight
hundred pounds for it.  You've burnt down my
premises, between you, you and Glory there.  You've
robbed me of a hundred or two hundred pounds worth
of property with your wilfulness or carelessness.  Now,
I want to know, how is it you have not built up my
farmhouse again?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can't do it.  I haven't the money!' wailed
Mrs. Sharland.  'I am sure, Master Rebow, there was
nothing but pure accident in the fire.  I never
thought——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Pure accident!' scoffed Elijah.  'Do you call that
pure accident, soaking the whole chamber in spirits,
with a fire burning on the hearth, and dashing the cask
staves here and there, on the fire and off it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah looked at him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ah, ha!  Glory!  You think I don't know it.
You think I didn't see you!  Why, I was at the
window.  I saw you do it.  Tell me, mother, did not
Glory smash the keg I had just given you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I believe she did, Elijah!  I am very sorry.  I
did my best to stop her, but she is a perverse, rebellious
girl.  You must forgive her, she intended no harm.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you saw me do it, why did you let the house
catch fire?' asked Mehalah, looking hard in Rebow's
face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Could I help it?' he asked in reply.  'There you
sat by the hearth, and no harm came of it.  At last
you went out, and locked and double-locked the door.
I went down to my boat.  I tell you, I was uneasy,
and I looked back, and I saw by the light in the room
that the spirit had caught.  I ran back and tried to
get in.  The floor was flaming.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The floor was of brick,' said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The door was fast locked.  You know best why
you locked it.  It never was fastened before that night.
You screwed on the lock, then you went out of the
place yourself, leaving the room on fire, and fastened
the door that none might get in.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A lie!' exclaimed the girl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Is it a lie?  I don't think it.  I can't cipher out
your doings any other way.  I tried to break open the
door, but you had put too stout a fastening on.  Then
I burst open the window, and when the wind got in, it
made the fire rage worse.  So I ran and shouted to my
men in the big boat, and I got a balk and I stove the
door in, and then it was too late to do more than save
your mother and her goods.  As for you, you left her
and them to burn together; you wanted to be off and
free of her.  I know you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, Master Rebow!  I know I'm a burden to her,
but she would not do that!' put in Mrs. Sharland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why did you watch me?' asked Mehalah, and
then regretted that she had put the question.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You see,' said Elijah turning to the officer, 'she
didn't think anyone was near to give evidence against
her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Here I am,' said Mehalah, 'put me in prison, do
with me what you will.  I am innocent of all intent
to burn the farm.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I could hang you for it,' laughed Elijah.  'That
pretty neck where the red handkerchief hangs so
jauntily would not look well with a hemp rope round
it.  You'd dangle on the Ray, where the house stood.
You'd have a black cap then pulled over those dark
eyes and brown skin, not a red one, not a red one,
Glory!' he rubbed his hands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have no warrant against you,' said the bailiff to
Mehalah.  'You stand charged with nothing.  The
warrant is against your mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Against me?  What will you do with me?' cried
the old woman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You must go to prison if you cannot build the
house up again, and restore it as good as it was to the
landlord.  He can't be at a loss by your neglect.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot do it.  I have not the money.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then you must go to prison till you get it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland sank on the gravel.  She wept and
wrung her hands.  This was worse than the burning of
the house, worse even than the lesion of the ear and
tail of the poodle.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I won't go.  I can't go!' she sobbed.  'I've the
ague so bad.  I suffer from rheumatism in all my bones.
Let me alone,' she pleaded, 'and I promise I'll go to
bed and never get out of it again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You'll suffer in prison, I can promise you,' said
Elijah exultingly.  'You'll have no bed to crawl into,
unless you can pay for it; you'll have no blankets to
wrap round you in the cold frosty night, if you can't
pay for them; you'll have no fire to shiver by when
there is ice on the ponds, if you haven't money to pay
for it.  The frost in your bones will make you shriek
and jabber in prison.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have no money.  I gave the last to pay off Mrs. De
Witt,' wailed the wretched woman.  'But there are
the sheep.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They go to pay your rent up to Lady Day, aye, and
till Michaelmas.  I haven't had notice yet that you are
about to quit.  You can't give up the farm without, and
I will exact every penny of my rent.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then I am at your mercy,' sobbed Mrs. Sharland.
She turned to Mehalah and pleaded, 'Haven't you a
word to say, to save me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl was silent.  What could she say?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come along, madam, it is of no use.  The warrant
is here, and come along you must.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not go to prison.  I will not.  I shall die of
cold and ague and rheumatics there.  My bones will
burst like water-pipes, and I'll shiver the teeth out of
my jaws and the nails off my fingers and toes.  I won't
go!' she screamed.  'You must carry me, I can't walk.
I'm a dying old woman.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Would you like to go back to Red Hall?' asked
Elijah gravely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh!  Master Rebow, if I might!  I could shiver
in comfort.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You and Glory!  You and Glory!'  He looked
from one to the other.  'I don't take back one without
the other.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Take me back!' wailed Mrs. Sharland.  'I know
you won't be so cruel as to send me to prison.  Let me
go back to my armchair; Mehalah! promise him everything.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will promise him nothing,' she said gloomily.
'If ever I hated this man, I hate him now.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then she must go to prison,' growled Rebow.
'Now look you here, Glory!  I don't ask much.  I only
ask you to go back with your mother, and work for me
as you have worked hitherto.  I do not say a word
about anything else.  You thought to escape me.  You
cannot.  I have told you all along that it is impossible.
As for the future, let the future determine.  I wish to
let you take your own course.  I will not say another
word about my wishes, till you come to me, of your own
accord, and say that you will be mine.  There!  I
promise you that.  I will not force you any further;
but I will not allow you to leave my house.  There you
must remain till you come to me and bid me take you,
till you come and give yourself freely into my hands.
Do you hear me, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah, save me,' pleaded Mrs. Sharland.  'Do
what you can to save me from prison.  Did I not lay
by for you when I was a widow and needy?  And will
you refuse me this?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'One thing or another,' said Rebow.  'Either your
mother rots in prison, with no escape possible till she
goes out to her grave in a pauper's shell, or you and
she return at once to Red Hall, on the same conditions
as you have been there hitherto, on the conditions you
proposed yourself.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah trembled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Let us go back,' said Mrs. Sharland.  'Help me
into the boat.  He couldn't have spoken more fair.
You see, Mehalah, the Ray house is a great loss to him,
and he gave eight hundred pounds for it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'And the marshes, and the saltings, and for you and
Glory, and all things,' put in Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah held out her arms.  Her head swam; she
stood as though balancing herself on a high wall.  Then
she clasped her hands over her forehead, and burst into
a storm of tears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Jim!' said Elijah, 'get the old doll into the stern,
and you row her back to Red Hall.  Take her under
your arm and chuck her in anyhow.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He looked at the convulsed girl with an ugly smile
of triumph.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Give me the warrant, bailiff!'  He took the paper,
held it under Mehalah's eyes and tore it in pieces, and
scattered them over the water.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Shove off, Jim.  Row the old bundle back quick.
Glory and I are going to drive home.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah looked up, with a gasp as though stung.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, Glory!  To-day is Valentine's Day.  Valentine's
Day it is.  I have my little gig here.  It
accommodates two beautifully.  I am going to take you up
by my side, and drive you home, </span><em class="italics">home</em><span>, to your home
and mine, Glory, in it; and all along the road, here at
the Rose where the horse is standing, at Peldon, at
Salcott and Virley,—all along the road,—at the parson's,
at the Rising Sun, at Farmer Goppin's,—everywhere
I'll let them see that I'm out a-junketing to-day along
with my Valentine.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>All power of resistance was gone from Mehalah.
The landlady at the Rose looked at her with pitying
eyes, as she was helped up into the gig.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I thought you was coming to us,' said the woman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You thought wrong,' answered Elijah with a
boisterous laugh.  'Glory is coming back to me.  We've
had a bit of a tiff, but have made it up.  Haven't we,
Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The girl's head fell in shame on her bosom.  She
could not speak, but the tears rolled out of her eyes and
streaked the 'Gloriana' on her breast.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He did not say a word to her as he drove home;
but he stopped wherever she had halted a few days
before.  At Peldon farm he drew up, and struck at the
door.  He asked if there was a bullock there to be
sold.  The woman came into the garden with him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Out a Valentining along with my lass,' he said,
indicating Mehalah with his whip over his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He arrested his horse at the parson's cottage, and
shouted till the door opened, and Mr. Rabbit appeared,
with Mrs. Rabbit behind his back, peeping over his
shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I say,' roared Rebow, 'one of those cursed brats of
yours has been on my marshes plaguing my cows, and
has run two of them lame.  Let him try it on again,
let him put his foot on my ground, and I'll cut it off,
and send him limping home.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He stopped at the Rising Sun and called for spirits,
and offered some to Mehalah.  She turned aside her
head in disgust; he drove up to Virley Hall farm, and
into the yard, and called forth Farmer Goppin and his
wife.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I tell you,' he said, 'one of my cattle has been
straying, I don't suppose she has done damage; she
got into this here yard, I'm told.  You turned her out.
I'm a man of few words, but I thank ye.  I am carrying
her home before she is pounded.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And then he drove straight to Red Hall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah descended, crushed, broken, no more
herself, the bold haughty girl of the Ray.  She crept
upstairs, took off her red cap and tore it with her
hands and teeth.  Her liberty was for ever gone from
her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her mother was in their common bedroom, the boat
had returned before the cart, for the way by water was
the shortest, and tide had favoured.  The old woman
babbled about her grievances, and rejoiced at Rebow's
magnanimity.  She was busy replacing all the little
articles that had been carried away, and were now
brought back.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah could not endure the thrumming of her
talk, and she hid herself in a corner of the little inner
apartment, an empty room lighted by a small triangular
window.  There she crouched in the corner, on the
ground, with her head on her knees and her hands in
her hair behind.  She sat there motionless.  The
fountain of her tears was dried up.  The hectic flames
burned in her cheeks, but all the rest of her face was
deadly in its pallor.  She could not think, she could
not feel.  She had experienced but one such another
period of agony, that when the medal was restored and
she knew that George was lost to her.  That moment
was sweet to this.  That was one of pure pain, this
of pain and humiliation, of crushed pride, of honour
trampled and dragged in the dirt.  Her self-respect
had had its death-wound, and she sat and let her heart
bleed away.  Once or twice she put her hand on the
floor.  She thought that that must have been flooded
with blood and tears, as if, when she took her hand up,
it must be steeped red.  It was not so.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But the soul has its ichor as well as the heart, and
when it is cut deep into it also drains away, and is left
empty, pulseless, pallid.  Mrs. Sharland came in and
spoke to her daughter, but got no answer.  Mehalah
looked up at her, but there was no expression in her
eyes, she did not hear, or if she heard, did not
understand what was said to her.  The old woman went away
muttering.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The evening fell, and Mehalah still sat crouched in
her corner.  The golden triangle which had stood on
the wall opposite her had moved to her side, turned to
silver, and now was but a nebulous patch on the white
plaster.  With the death of the day some abatement
came to Mehalah's distress.  She moved her cramped
limbs.  She rose to her knees, and fixed her eyes on the
sky that glimmered grey through the triangular window.
A star was hanging there.  She saw it, and looked
at it long, it shone through her eyes and down into the
dark abyss in her soul.  By little her ideas began to
shape themselves; recollections of the past formed
over that despairing gulf; she could not think of the
present; she had not the power or the will to look into
the future.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A year had passed since, on such an evening as this,
looking on that star, she had stood with George de
Witt on the Ray beneath the thorn trees, and he had
gaily called her his Valentine, and given her in jest a
picture of the Goddess of Liberty as proclaimed in
Paris, wearing the bonnet rouge.  She a goddess!  She
who was now so weak.  Her power was gone.  Liberty!
She had none.  She was a slave.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She drew herself up on her knees, and strained her
united fingers, with the palms outward, towards that
glittering star, and moaned, 'My Valentine!  My
George, my George!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Suddenly, as if in answer to that wail from her
wounded heart, there came a crash, and then loud,
pealing, agonising, a cry from below out of the depths,
and yet in the air about—'Glory!  Glory!  Glory!'</span></p>
