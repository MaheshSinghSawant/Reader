<p class="pfirst"><span>When the boat reached the landing place for Red Hall,
Mrs. Sharland was found to have been so overcome with
terror, and numbed with frost, as to be unable to walk.
She moaned under her blankets, but made no effort to
rise.  Elijah was obliged to carry her out of the boat
upon the sea-wall, and then with the assistance of
Mehalah she was conveyed to the house in their arms.
Neither spoke, and Mrs. Sharland's lamentations, over
various articles she had prized, and which she feared
were lost or destroyed, remained unattended to.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman was wrapped up from the cold in a
blanket that enfolded her entire person and head, and
she kept working an aperture for her face, whilst being
carried, not so much to obtain air, as to give vent to
queries.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My green bombazine,—where is it?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The folds of the blanket closed over the face.  The
fingers worked at them, till they had made a gap.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Is the toad-jug saved?' at the same time a point
of a nose and a thin finger emerged from the wraps.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There was a dozen of Lowestoft soup-dishes!'  A
jerk as she was being lifted over a rail sent her head
and shoulders deeper into the blanket, and it was
some minutes before she had grubbed a hole for herself
again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The warming-pan!  I can't go to bed unless I have
the sheets aired.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A spring across a dyke buried the old woman again
'in woollen.'  She emerged only as the house was
reached to exclaim 'My rum!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You've come where there's lots of that,' said Elijah,
and he indicated with his chin to Mehalah to carry her
up the steps into the hall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A red fire was glowing and painting the walls.  The
great room was warm, and Mrs. Sharland battled out of
her envelopes as soon as she became aware that she was
under cover.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Take me to bed,' she said; 'my legs are frozen.
I can't go a step.  Oh! is the toad-jug saved?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will carry her now,' said Elijah.  'You light a
candle, Glory, and follow me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He took the old woman over his shoulder, and led
the way up the stairs.  Mehalah followed with a light
she had kindled at the hearth.  He conducted into a
bed-room, comfortably furnished, with white curtains
to the windows, and a low tester bed in the corner.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Light the fire,' he ordered, and Mehalah applied
the candle to the straw and chips in the grate.
Presently the flames were dancing up the chimney,
and making the whole chamber glow.  The old woman
was laid on the bed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This looks comfortable,' said she; 'just as if you
was prepared for us.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I was prepared for you.  Everything was ready.
Glory knows that I have been expecting you and her.
I told her she must come, sooner or later.  Sooner or
later the same roof must cover both, as sooner or later
the same grave will hold us both.  She would fight me,
and would not come to me, but her destiny is stronger
than her will.  My will is the destiny of her life.  It
shapes and directs it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah did not speak.  She could not speak.
She was stunned.  A belt of iron bound her heart and
restrained its free bounds, a weight of lead crushed her
brain and killed its independence of action.  She, who
had been hitherto a law to herself, whose will had been
unfettered, now discovered herself a captive under the
thraldom of a will mightier, or more ungovernable, than
her own.  She had no time or power to think how to
escape, and free herself from the situation in which she
was placed.  All her thoughts that she could collect
must be about her mother.  She must think of herself
when she had more leisure.  But though she could not
think of herself, she could feel that she was conquered,
and a captive, and that escape would not be easy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There,' said Elijah, indicating a door, 'there is
another little room for you and your mother to put
away what you like.  If you want anything, come
downstairs.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah went heavily down the stairs and out at the
door.  Mehalah looked from the window, and saw him
on his way to the boat.  He was going back to the
Ray.  She could still see a red cloud hanging over her
burnt home.  The tears rose in her heart at the sight,
but would not well out at her eyes.  She stood and
looked long at the dying fire, drawing the window
curtain behind her to screen from her the light of
the room.  Her mother lay quiet, evidently pleased
at having got into such comfortable quarters, and
exhausted with her alarm.  By degrees she dozed off into
unconsciousness of her loss and of her situation, and
Mehalah remained at the window looking moodily over
the fens and the water, at the ruby spark that marked
her old home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She was standing in the same place when the boats
arrived, bringing portions of their goods to Red Hall.
She heard the voices of Rebow and other men below.
She opened the door and listened.  He was giving
them something to eat and drink.  Abraham Dowsing
was there.  She could distinguish his voice.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If I hadn't turned you out, you'd have been burnt,'
said Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A good job for mistress we saved the cowhouse,'
answered Abraham, with sulky unwillingness to admit
that he was indebted to Elijah for anything.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't you think you owe me your life?' asked
Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The cowhouse didn't burn.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No.  But it would have, had not we been there to
keep the flames off,' observed one of the men.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Good job for mistress I wasn't burnt.  I don't
know how she'd got along without me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It did not matter particularly to yourself then,
Abby?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't know as it did.  A man must die some
time, and I've always heard as smothering is a nice
quiet sort of death—better than being racked with
cramps and tormented with rheumatics and shivered
into the pithole with agues.'  After a pause Abraham's
voice was heard to add, 'Besides, I should have woke,
myself, with the fire and smoke.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Not you.  And if you had, what could you have
done to save the old woman?  She'd have been burnt
to a cinder before you woke.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That's mistress' matter, not mine,' answered
Dowsing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You could not have got the things out of the house.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They are not mine,' retorted Abraham angrily.
'You are not going to make a merit to me of saving
what are the belongings of other folk?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They belong to your mistress.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, so they do, that is, they don't belong to me;
so none of your boasting to me, as if I owed you
anything.'  This ungracious remark, but one not unnatural
for a rude peasant jealous lest an obligation should place
him in a position of disadvantage, was followed by
silence, during which the party ate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently Abraham asked, 'How came you to be there?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Master sent Jim out with me in the big boat after
ducks, and he was in the punt,' answered one of the
men.  'He bade us lie by at the mouth of the Rhyn,
while he went on to drive the birds our way; there was
a lot, and we thought to pepper into a whole flight.  He
was not long away—not above an hour—when we saw
the Ray house afire, and heard him shouting to us to
come on, so we rowed as hard as hard, and by the time we
landed he had broke open the door, and got the old lady
out.  We helped as best we might, and saved a deal of
things.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They ain't worth much,' said Abraham.  'There's
nothing in the house worth five pound,—take the whole
lot.  The cow was the only thing would pay for saving,
and she was safe.  I slept in the loft over her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The life of your mistress was worth something, I
hope, Abby.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't know that.  Not to me, anyhow.  She's not
mistress; it is Mehalah that orders, and does everything.
I don't reckon an old woman's life is worth a crown, not
to nobody but herself, may be; but that is her concern
not mine.  She was an ailing aguish body.  Why!'
exclaimed Abraham banging his can of ale on the table,
'when you've saved an old woman who is nought but a
trouble to everybody as does with her, of what wally is
it?  They might have paid you to let her alone, but
not to lug her out of the fire.  Now, Mehalah, she was
another sort.  But you didn't save her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where was she?  She was not in the house.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'How am I to know?  I don't spy after her.
Others may,' he gave a sly, covert look at Elijah, 'I
don't.  But I reckon she was out on the saltings
watching for the sheep-stealers.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you had sheep-stealers on the Ray?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Aye, we have.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Did you watch for them at night?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I!' with a grunt.  'They were not my sheep.
No, thank you.  Let them that wallys the sheep watch
'em.  I do what I'm paid to do, and I don't do more.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah did not listen to the whole of this
conversation.  She had satisfied herself that Abraham was
there, and had heard how Rebow and his men came to be
on the spot when the fire broke out; she then closed
the door again, and returned to the window.  She did
not leave her station till dawn, except to attend to the
fire, to make it up from the heap stacked by the side
of the chimneypiece.  When day began to break, she
seated herself on a stool by the bed, and laying her
head on the mattress fell asleep, and slept for an hour
or two, uneasily, troubled by dreams and the discomfort
of her position.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she awoke the house was quiet.  She went
downstairs, with reluctance, and found no one stirring,
but the fire made up and a kettle boiling over it, the
table spread with everything she could desire for
breakfast.  Elijah, Abraham, and the other men were gone.
There was a canister with tea on the board.  Mehalah
made her mother some, and took it up to her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old woman was awake, and drank the tea with
eagerness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't think I can get out of bed to-day, Mehalah!'
she said.  'I feel my limbs all of an ache; the cold
has got into the marrow of my bones, and I feel as if
the frost were splitting them, as at times it will split
pipes.  I must lie abed till the thaw comes to them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Can you eat anything?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I think I can.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mother, how long are we going to remain here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is wery comfortable, I am sure.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But we cannot stay in this house.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where else can we go?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will get into service somewhere.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You cannot leave me.  Where shall I go?  I cannot
leave my bed, and I don't think the frost will get out
of my bones for a week or more.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can not, I will not, remain here.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where can we go?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah put both her hands to her brow.  She
could not answer this question.  Were she alone, she
could get a situation in a farmhouse, perhaps; but with
a sick mother dependent on her, this was not possible.
No farmer would take them both in for the sake of her
services.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where else can we go?' again asked Mrs. Sharland;
then in a repining voice, 'If Master Rebow houses us
for a while, it is very good of him, and we must be
thankful, for we have no chance of shelter elsewhere.
Where is the money to pay for rebuilding the
farmhouse?  Do you think my cousin, Charles
Pettican——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, no,' exclaimed Mehalah, 'not a word about him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He spoke up and promised most handsomely,' said
Mrs. Sharland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He can do nothing, mother, I will not ask him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'A man that has a gilded balcony to his house
wouldn't miss a few pounds for running up a wooden
cottage.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not go to him again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My dear child,' said Mrs. Sharland, 'I don't doubt
he would take us in on a visit for a while, when we are
forced to leave Red Hall.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You think we shall not be obliged to remain here?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't see how we can.  It is very good of Master
Rebow to house us for a bit, but I doubt we can't stick
as fixtures.  I only wish we could.  Anyhow stay here
a bit we must.  We have nowhere else to go to, except
to my cousin Charles.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah knew what this alternative was worth.  It
was a relief to her to hear her mother speak of their
stay in Red Hall as only temporary.  She could not
endure to contemplate the possibility of its being
permanent.  She formed a hope that she would be able to
find work somewhere, and hire a small cottage; she
was strong enough to do as much as a man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>During the day, everything that had been rescued
from the fire on the Ray was brought to Red Hall, even
the cow, which was driven round by land, a matter of
eleven miles.  The old clock arrived, and was set up in
the large room below, an old cypress chest or 'sprucehutch'
as Mrs. Sharland called it, covered with curious
shallow carvings picked out with burnt umber, representing
a hawking party, that contained her best clothes,
and was a security against moth, was conveyed into her
bedroom.  It weighed half a ton.  The old Lowestoft
dishes she valued were placed in the rack in the hall
along with the ware that belonged to Elijah.  The
toad-jug, a white jug with a painted and glazed figure of a
toad squatting inside it in the neck, was also brought to
Red Hall, so even were two biscuit-china poodles with
shaven posteriors and with manes and tufted tails,
that had stood on the chimneypiece at the Ray.  The
warming-pan of brass with a stamped portrait of
H.M. George I. on it was likewise transported to Red Hall,
and hung up in the little oak-panelled parlour behind
the entrance hall generally occupied by Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>By degrees most of the property of Mrs. Sharland
was brought to the house, and the small oak parlour
was furnished with it.  Her arm-chair of leather with
high back was placed in the hall by the great fireplace
that bore the inscription, 'When I hold, I hold fast.'  There
were also some things belonging specially to Glory
that had been saved, and these were put in the oak
parlour.  The satisfaction of Mrs. Sharland at finding
herself surrounded by her goods was extreme.  She did
not leave her bed, but she insisted on her daughter
bringing her up everything that could be carried,
that she might turn it about, and inspect it minutely
and rejoice over what was uninjured, and bewail
what had suffered.  One of the poodles had lost an
ear and part of its tail.  The old woman cried and
grumbled and scolded about this injury, as though it
were on a level with the destruction of the house.  She
would see the men Jim and Joe who had brought it
from the Ray in the boat; she catechised them minutely,
she insisted on knowing which had brought the dog
out of the burning house, where it had been placed till
removal, and fretted, till they promised to examine the
spot beneath the thorn tree where the china brute had
spent the night, and also the bottom of the boat, for the
missing tail tuft and ear tip.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You know,' she said, 'if I boil them in milk with
the dog, I can get them to stick on.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Among certain persons, the mind is destitute of
perspective, and consequently magnifies trifles and
disregards great evils.  Mrs. Sharland had a mind thus
constituted.  She harped all day on the battered
biscuit-china dog, because it was placed on the mantelpiece
of her bedroom, and was under her eyes whenever she
turned her head that way.  The farmhouse was almost
forgotten in her distress about the tail; her flaming
home formed but a red background to the mutilated
white poodle.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah saw nothing of Elijah Rebow all day.  He
was several times in the house; directly her foot sounded
on the stairs, however, he disappeared.  But she saw
and felt that he was considering her; his care to recover
all the little treasures and property on the Ray evinced
this; and in the house he provided everything she could
need; he placed meat on the table in the hall for her
dinner, and had boiled potatoes over the fire.  They
were set ready for her, she had only to take them out.
Her mother ate heartily, and was loud in expressions of
satisfaction at the comfort that surrounded them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I hope, Mehalah, we shan't have to leave this in a
hurry.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Glory did not answer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Towards evening Abraham Dowsing arrived with the
cow.  The girl heard the low, and ran down—she could
not help it—and threw her arms round the neck of the
beast.  There was a back stair leading to the kitchen
and yard, by which she could descend without entering
the hall, and by this means she avoided Elijah, who, she
was aware, was there.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah, however, came to the top of the steps after
she had descended, and looked into the yard where she
was.  Mehalah at once desisted from lavishing her
tenderness on the animal.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Abraham stood sulkily by.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I've had a long bout,' he said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I dare say you have, Abraham,' she answered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I want something to eat and drink, I haven't bit
nought since morning.  There's nothing but ashes on
the Ray now, and they are red-hot.  You don't expect
me to fill my belly on them.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah put her hand to her mouth and checked
her tongue, as she was about to tell him to go indoors
and get some supper.  She had now nothing to give the
old man.  She lived on the bounty of Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot go without my wittles,' persisted Abraham.
'Now I want to know where my wittles are to come
from.  I paid fourpence at the Rose for some bread and
cheese, and you owes me that.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is the money,' said Mehalah producing the
coin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Ah! that is wery well.  But where am I to get my
wittles now?  Am I your servant or ain't I?  If I
am,—where's my wittles?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come here, Abraham,' said Elijah, from the kitchen
door.  'There is bread and cold potatoes and meat here.
You shall have your supper, and you can sleep in the
loft.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look here, master,' pursued the sullen old man,
'I want to know further where I'm to look for my
wages.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'To me,' said Rebow.  'I take you on.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where am I to work?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Here, or on the Ray, looking after the sheep.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The sheep are not yours, they are hers,'—pointing
to Mehalah with his thumb.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The Ray and Red Hall are one concern,' answered
Rebow.  'You look to me as your master, and to her
as your mistress;' then he entered and slammed the
door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Abraham shrugged his shoulders.  He leered at
Mehalah, who had put her hands to her forehead.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'When are you going to church?  Eh, mistress?  I
thought it was coming to this.  But I don't care so long
as I gets my wittles and wage.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Abraham went slowly into the cattlehouse with the
cow.  Mehalah remained rooted to the spot, pressing
her brow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was more than she could endure.  She ran up
the steps, she would speak to Rebow while her heart was
full.  She dashed through the kitchen and into the hall.
He was not there.  As she ran on, she tripped and
almost fell; and recovered herself with horror.  She
had almost precipitated herself through the trap into
the vault beneath.  The door was thrown back, her
foot had caught this.  Faugh!  an odour rose from the
cellar as from the lair of a wild beast.  She looked in,
there was the maniac racing up and down in the den
fastened by his chain, jabbering and uttering incoherent
cries.  He was almost naked, covered with filthy rags,
and his hair hung over his face so that she could
distinguish no features by the dim light that strayed down
from the trap, and from the horn lanthorn that Elijah
had placed on the steps.  Rebow had a pitchfork, and
he was tossing fresh straw to his brother, and raking
out the sodden and crushed litter of the wretched man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah could not bear the sight; she withdrew.
She needed a little while by herself to consider what
was best to be done, to think of what had taken place.
She opened the front door, and descended by the long
flight of steps over the arch.  Then she saw that a
shutter covered the circular window that in summer
lighted the den of the maniac.  This was now closed
to shut out the cold of winter.  There was a door.  As
she looked, Rebow opened it from within, and appeared,
raking out the litter and the gnawed bones, the relics
of his brother's repasts.  He did not notice her, or he
pretended not to do so, and she shrank back.  Her
wish to speak with him had gone from her.  She was
not equal to an interview till she had been alone for a
while, and had gathered up her strength.  An interview
with him must be a contest.  It was clear to her
that he was resolved that she should stay at Red Hall.
She was equally determined not to do so.  But how to
get away and remove her mother was more than she
could discover.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She left the house and the garden round it, and
walked through the meadow till she reached the sea-wall.
She ascended that, and went along it to the spot
where the Red Hall marsh divided the Tollesbury Fleet
from the Virley and Salcott Creeks.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then she threw herself beneath the windmill, the
mill that pumped the water out of the dykes, and
worked day and night whenever there was wind to
move the sails.  The mill was now at work.  The
wings rushed round, and the pump painfully creaked,
and after every stroke sent a dash of water into the
sea over the wall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah hoped that here, away from her mother
and Rebow, and the sights and sounds of Red Hall, she
might be able to think.  But it was not so.  Her
numbed head was unable to form any plans.  She
looked out at sea, it was leaden grey, ruffled with angry
waves, and the mews screamed and dipped in them.
The sky overhead was overcast.  The Bradwell shore
looked grey and bleak and desolate; there was not a
sail in the offing.  The fancy took her to sit and wait,
and if she saw a ship pass to take it as a good omen, a
promise of escape from her present perplexity.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She sat and waited.  The sea darkened to a more
sullen tint.  The mews were no longer visible.  Mersea
with its trees and church tower disappeared.  Bradwell
coast loomed black as pitch against the last lingering
light of day.  Not a sail appeared.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Far away, out to sea, as the darkness deepened,
gleamed a light.  It gleamed a moment, then grew
dim and disappeared in the blackness.  A minute, and
then it waxed, but waned again, and once more all was
night.  So on, in wearisome iteration.  What she saw
was the revolving Swin light fifteen miles from land,
a floating Pharos.  She thought of Elijah's words, she
thought of the horrible iterations in the barrow on the
hill, the embracing and fighting, embracing and fighting,
loving and hating, loving and hating, till one should
conquer of the twin but rival powers.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Mehalah returned slowly to the house, her spirits
oppressed with gloom.  It was night without and
within, before her face, and in her soul.  The wind
sighed and sobbed among the rushes and over the fen,
in a disconsolate, despairing manner, and the breath of
God within—the living soul—sighed and sobbed like
His breath that blew over the wintry marsh without.
Not a star looked down from His heaven above, and
none looked up from His heaven below in the little
confines of a human heart.  Mehalah could scarce see
her way in the fen, among the dykes and drains; she
was as unable to find a path in the level of her life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She reached Red Hall at last, and mounted the front
stairs to the principal door.  She would see Elijah now.
It were better to speak with him and come to some
understanding at once.  It was intolerable to allow the
present position to remain unexplained, and the future
undetermined.  She hesitated at the door.  It was not
without a struggle that she could open it and go in and
face the man whose hospitality she was receiving and
yet whom she abhorred.  She knew that she was greatly
indebted to him.  He had saved her mother's life, he
had secured from destruction a large amount of their
property; yet she could not thank him.  She resented
his intrusion into their affairs, when anyone else would
have been unobjectionable.  She disliked him all the
more because she knew she was heavily in his debt;
it galled her almost past endurance to feel that she and
her mother were then subsisting on his bounty.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Come in, Glory!' shouted Elijah from within, as
she halted at the door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She entered.  He was seated by the fire with his
pipe in his hand; he had heard her step on the stairs,
and had paused in his smoking, and had waited in a
listening, expectant attitude.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He signed her to take a chair—her mother's chair—on
the other side of the hearth.  She paid no attention
to the sign, but stood in the middle of the room, and
unconsciously covered her eyes with her hands.  Her
pulses quivered in her temples.  Her heart grew cold,
and a faintness came over her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'The light is not too strong to dazzle you,' said
Elijah, 'put your hands down, I want to see your face.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She made an effort to retain them where they were,
but could not; they fell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sit down.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sit down.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I want to speak with you, Elijah, for a moment.
I must speak with you.'  Her heart palpitated, her
breast heaved.  She could only utter short sentences.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Sit down there!' he beckoned with the stalk of
his pipe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She still refused to obey.  Her power was slipping
from her.  The exhaustion after the excitement she
had gone through had affected even her stout will.
She resolved to oppose him in this trifling matter,
but knew that her resolution was infirm.  She clung
desperately to what remained to her of power.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will not listen to a word you say unless you sit
down.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He paused, and looked at her; then he said, 'Go
to your mother!' and continued his smoking, with face
averted.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah, I know what you have done, and are doing
now for my mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He sprang from his seat, and strode up and down
the room, turning and glowering at her, sucking at his
pipe, and making it red and angry like his eyes in the
firelight.  He walked fast and noisily on the brick
floor, with his high shoulders up and his head down.
She watched him with painful apprehension; he
reminded her of the mad brother pacing in the vault
below.  She could not speak to him whilst he persisted
in this irritating, restless tramp.  There was no help
for it.  She dropped into her mother's leather chair.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There!' said he, and he flung a ring with some
keys attached to it, into her lap.  'Take them.  They
are yours now.  The keys of everything in the house,
except of——' he jerked his pipe towards the den
beneath.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot take them,' she said, and let them slide
off her lap upon the floor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Pick them up!' he ordered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No,' she said firmly, 'I will not.  Elijah, we must
come to an understanding with each other.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'We already understand each other,' he said, pausing
in his walk.  'We always did.  I can read your heart.
I know everything that passes there, just as if it was
written in red letters on a page.  I understand you, and
there's nobody else in the world that can.  I was made
to read you.  I heard a Baptist preacher say one day that
God wrote a book, and then He created mankind to read
it.  You are a book, and God made me to read you.
I can do it.  That wants no scholarship, it comes by
nature to me.  Others can't.  They might puzzle and
rack their heads, they'd make nothing of you.  But you
are clear as light of day to me.  You understand me?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You </span><em class="italics">will</em><span> not.  You set your obstinate, wicked
mind against understanding me.  I heard a preacher
once say—I went to chapel along of my mother when I
was a boy; I goes nowhere now but to the Ray after
you—What is God?  It is that as makes a man, and
keeps him alive, and gives him hopes of happiness, or
plunges him in hell.  Every man has his own God; for
there is something different makes and mars each man.
What do I want but you, Glory?  It is you that can
make and keep me alive, and you are my happiness or
my hell.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But,' said he standing still again, and flourishing
his hand and pipe, 'as I was saying, I heard a preacher
say once, that God made every man of a lump of clay
and a drop of spittle, and that He made always two at
a time.  He couldn't help it.  He has two hands and
ain't right and left handed as we, but works with both,
and then He casts about the men He has made,
anywhere.  Hasn't He made all things double?  Have not
you two hands and two feet and two eyes?  Is there
not a sun and a moon, are there not two poles to the
earth, and two sexes, and day and night, and winter
and summer? and—' he went up before Mehalah, and
with a burst of passion—'and you and me?'  Then he
recommenced his pacing, but slower, and continued,
'Wherever those two are that God made with His two
hands, they must come together.  It don't matter
where they be, if one is in Mersea, and t'other is in
Asia, or Africa, or China, or America, or London, it
don't matter, soon or late, they must come together,
and when they come together then they are in heaven.
Now if a man takes some other left-handed figure—it
was the left hand made woman—then it don't matter,
he can't go against his destiny.  He has taken the
wrong woman, and he is not happy.  He knows it all
along, and he feels restless and craving in his soul, and
if he does not find the proper one in this world when
he goes out of it, he waits and wanders, till the proper
one dies and begins to hunt about for her right-hand
man.  That is what makes ghosts to ramble.  Ghosts
are those that have married the wrong ones, wandering
and waiting, and seeking for their right mates.  Do
you hear the piping and the crying at the windows
of a winter night?  That is the ghosts looking in and
sobbing because they are out in the cold shivering till
they meet their mates.  But when they meet, then
that is heaven.  There's a heaven for everyone, but
that is only once for all when the two doubles find each
other, and if that be not in this life, why it is after.
And there is a hell too, but that isn't reserved for all,
and it does not last for ever and ever, but is only when
one has taken the wrong mate and has found it out.'  He
stopped.  He had become very earnest and excited
by what he had said.  He came again over against
Mehalah.  'Glory!' he continued, 'don't you see how
the moon goes after the sun and cannot come to him?
She is his proper mate and double, and the sun don't
know, and won't have it, and so day and night, and winter
and summer, and waxing and waning goes on and on.
But that won't go on for ever.  The sun will grow sad
at heart, and wane for want of the moon some day, and
then there will be a great flare and blaze and glory, and
they will be in heaven.  And now the two poles of the
earth are apart, and so long as they keep apart, the
world rolls on in misery and pain, and that is what
makes earthquakes, and volcanoes, and great plagues—the
poles are apart which ought to be together.
But they are drawing gradually nearer each other.
The seasons now are not what they used to be, and that
is it.  The poles are not where they were, they are
straining to meet.  And some day they will run into
one, and that will be the end.  I've heard say that in
the Bible it is spoken that there'll be an end of this
world.  I could have known that without the Bible.
The poles must come together some day, and be one.
Glory!' he went on, 'you and I are each other's
doubles, you was made with God's left hand, and I with
his right, at the same moment of time, and He cast
you into the Ray, and me to Red Hall.  There was not
much space between, only some water and ooze and
marsh, and we've been drawing and drawing nearer and
closer for ever so long, and now you are here, under my
roof.  You can't help it.  You cannot fight agin it.
You was made for me and I for you, and you'll have a
life of hell unless you take me now.  I must be yours.
You thought you'd resist and take George De Witt.
It might have been.  Suppose you had, and I had died
years before you.  You would have heard me crying at
your window and beating at your door, and you would
have felt me drawing and drawing of you, whether you
chose or not, taking the heart away from your George,
and bringing it to me.  Then at last, you'd have died,
and then, then, you'd have been mine, and you would
have found our heaven after thirty, forty, fifty years of
hell.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The terrible earnestness of the man imposed on
Mehalah.  He spoke what he believed.  He gave
utterance, in his rude fierce way, to what he felt.  She,
untaught, full of dim gropings after something higher,
vaster, than the flat, narrow life she led, was startled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Heaven with you!' she cried, drawing back; 'never! never!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Heaven with me, and with none but me.  You
can't get another heaven but in my arms, for you was
made for me by God.  I told you so, but you would not
believe it.  Try, if you like, to find it elsewhere.  God
didn't make you and George De Witt out of one lump.
He couldn't have done it—You, Glory! strong, great,
noble, with a will of iron, and that weak, helpless,
vulgar lout, tied to his mother's apron.  He couldn't
have done it.  He made, like enough, Phoebe Musset
and George De Witt out of one piece, but you and me
was moulded together at the same time, out of the
same clay, and the same breath is in our hearts, and
the same blood in our veins.  You can't help it, it is so.
You can not, you shall not, escape me.  Soon or late
you must find your proper mate, soon or late you must
seek your double, soon or late find your heaven.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He came now quietly and seated himself in his
chair opposite Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What did you fare to say, Glory?' he asked.  'I
interrupted you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must thank you first for what you have done for
my mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have done nothing for her,' said Elijah sharply.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You drew her out of the burning house.  You
saved her goods from the flames.  You have sheltered
her here.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have done nothing for her,' said Elijah again.
'Whatever I have done, I did for you.  But for you
she might have burned, and I would not have put out
a finger to help her.  What care I for her?  She is
naught to me.  She wasn't destined for me; that was
you.  I saved her because she was </span><em class="italics">your</em><span> mother.  I
collected your things from the blazing house.  I have
taken you in.  I take her in only as I might take in
your shoe, or your cow, because it is yours.  She is
naught to me.  I don't care if I never saw or heard her
again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He got up and went to the window, took a flask
thence; then brought his gun from a corner, and began
to polish the brass fittings with rag, having first put on
the metal some of the vitriol from the bottle.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look at this,' he said, dropping some of the acid
on the tarnished brass.  'Look how it frets and boils
till it has scummed away the filth, and then the brass
is bright as gold.  That's like me.  I'm fretted and
fume with your opposition, and I dare say it is as well
I get a little.  But after a bit it will bring out the
shining metal.  You will see what I am.  You don't
like me now, because I'm not shapely and handsome as
your George De Witt.  But there is the gold metal
underneath; he was but gilt pinchbeck—George De
Witt!' he repeated.  'That was a fancy of yours, that
he was your mate!  You could not have loved him a
week after you'd known what he was.  Marriage would
have rubbed the plating off, and you would have
scorned and cast him aside.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah!' said Mehalah, 'I cannot bear this.  I
loved once, and I shall love for ever,—not
you!—you—never,' with gathering emphasis, 'George, only
George, none but George.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'More fool you,' said Rebow sulkily.  'Only I don't
believe it.  You say so to aggravate me, but you don't
think it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not care to pursue the subject.  She had
spoken out her heart, and was satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, what else had you to say?  I didn't think
you was one of the bread and butter curtsey-my-dears
and thanky, sirs!  That is a new feature in you, Glory!
It is the first time I've had the taste of thanks from
you on my tongue.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You never gave me occasion before.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No more I did,' he answered.  'You are right
there.  And I don't care for thanks now.  I'd take
them if I valued them, but I don't.  I don't care to
have them from you.  I don't expect thanks from my
body when I feed it, nor from my hands when I warm
'em at the fire; they belong to me, and I give 'em their
due.  What I do for you I do for myself, for the same
reason.  You belong to me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I must speak,' said Mehalah.  'This is more than
I can endure.  You say things of me, and to me, which
I will not suffer.  Do you mean to insult me?  Have I
ever given you the smallest reason to encourage you to
assume this right?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No.  But it must be.  You can't always go against
fate.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not believe in this fate, this destiny, of which
you talk,' said the girl gathering up her strength, as her
indignation swelled within her.  'You have no right
over me whatever.  I have been brought here against
my will, but at the same time I cannot do other than
acknowledge your hospitality.  Had you not given us a
shelter, I know not whither we should have gone.  I
ask you to let us shelter here a little longer, but only
a little longer, till I have found some situation where
I can work, and support my mother.  We must sell
our little goods, our sheep and cow, and with the
proceeds——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'With the proceeds you will have to pay the rent of
the Ray to Lady Day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You cannot be so ungenerous,' gasped Mehalah,
flashing wrathfully against him.  'This undoes all your
kindness in housing us.  But if it must be, so be it.
We will sell all, and pay you every penny; yes, and
for our keep in this house, as long as we are forced to
remain.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Not so fast, Glory,' said Elijah composedly.  'There
are various things to be considered first.  You can't
find a situation—no one would take you in along of an
old bedridden mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I can but try.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Aye, try; try by all means, and then come back
to me.  You have tried a deal of tricks to escape me,
but you can't do it.  You tried by borrowing money of
George De Witt, you tried by going to that old palsied
shipbuilder, you tried at Parson Tyll's, you tried, I
don't know how at last, and you got the money; but
yet you couldn't escape me.  You tried to get George
De Witt as your husband, to keep you from me in life,
but it came to naught.  He's gone out of the path that
leads from you to me.  You may heap up what you will,
but the earth will open, and swallow all obstructions,
and leave the way smooth and open.  Did you ever see
the old place—they call it the Devil's Walls—by Payne's?
No, I dare say you don't know thereabouts.  Well, I'll
tell you how that spot lies waste, and covered with
brambles and nettles now.  The old lords D'Arcy thought
to build a castle there.  Then the Salcott creek ran up
so far, and they could row and sail right up to their
gates, were the mansion built.  But it could not be.
The masons built all day, and at night the earth sucked
the walls in.  They worked there a whole year, and they
brought stones from Kent, and they poured in boulders,
and they laid bricks, but it was all of no good, the
earth drank in everything they put on it, as water.  At
last they gave it up, and they built instead on the hill
where stands Barn Hall.  It will be the same with you.
You may build what you like, and where you like, it
will go; it cannot stand, it will be swallowed up; you
can only build on me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah!  I insist on your listening to me.  I will
not hear this.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You will not?  I do not care, you must.  My will
will drink in yours.  But go on; say what you wish.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I am going to propose this.  Pay me a wage, and
I will work here.  I will attend to the house and the
cows, and do anything you require of me.  You have
no servant, and you need one.  You shall let me be
your servant.  I shall not be ashamed to be that, but I
will not remain here unless my place be determined and
recognised.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You shall be the mistress.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I do not want, I do not choose to be anything else
in this house but your hired servant.  Pay me a wage,
and I will remain till I can find some other situation;
refuse, and, if I have to leave my mother, I will go out
of this house to-night.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'If you leave your mother, I will throw her out.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I would fetch her away.  I would carry her in my
arms.  I will not stay here on any other terms.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will humour you.  You shall be paid.  I will
give you five shillings a week.  Is that enough?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'More than enough, with my keep and that of my
mother.  I thank you now.  In future speak of me to
the men as their fellow-servant, and not as you did
recently to Abraham as their mistress.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I shall speak to them as I like.  Am I to be
controlled by you?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then I will leave.  I will carry my mother to the
inn at Salcott, and rest there till I can find some other
shelter.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now look here, Glory,' said Elijah.  He put his
gun aside, and leaned his elbows on his knees, and faced
her.  'It is of no use your talking of running away
from me.  You may run, but I can draw you back.  I
sit here of a night brooding over my fire, I begin
thinking of you.  I think, I think, and then a spirit
takes me as it were, and fills me with fierce will, to
bring you here.  I feel I have threads at every finger
and threads to my knees and to my feet, all fast to you,
and if I stir, I move you.  I lift my finger, and you
raise yours.  I wave my hand up, and you throw up
yours.  You don't know it.  I do.  I know that I have
but to rise up from my chair, and I lift you up
wherever you may be, in your bed, in your grave, and then,
if I draw in with my will, I wind up these threads, and
you come, you come, from wheresoever you are, out of
your bed in your smock, out of your grave in your
shroud; doors are nothing, my will can burst them
open; locks are naught, my will can wrench them off;
the screws in the coffin lid and five feet of earth are
nothing, I could draw you through all.  I could draw
you over the ooze, and you would not be sucked in by it.
I could draw you over the water, and you would not wet
your foot.  I could draw you through the marsh and you
would not break a bullrush; look there—' he waved his
arm towards the door.  'That door would fly open, and
there you would stand, like one dreaming, with your
eyes wide open as they are now, with your cheek colourless
as now, with your lips parted as now, helpless, unable
to stir a finger, or utter a sound, against my will,
and you would rush into my arms, and fall on my heart.
I can do all that.  I feel it.  I know it.  I have sat here
and wanted to do it, but I have not.  I would not have
you come to me in that way, but come of your own free
will.  You must come to me one way or other.  Look
here!' he raised his hand, and involuntarily,
unconsciously, she lifted hers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Pick up the keys.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She stooped and took them up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'One day,' he said, 'you refused to take a piece of
money that fell, when I bade you.  Now you are more
compliant.  My will is gaining over yours.  Your will
is stout and rebellious, but it must bend and give way
before mine.  Go; I have done with you for the
present.'</span></p>
