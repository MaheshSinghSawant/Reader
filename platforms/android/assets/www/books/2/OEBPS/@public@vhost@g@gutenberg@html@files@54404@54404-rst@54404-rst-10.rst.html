<p class="pfirst"><span>Mehalah was lost to consciousness, leaning on the gate,
her aching brow and leaden eyes in her hand.  She did
not hear the larks that sang above her, nor saw the
buttercups and daisies that smiled to her from below.
By the gate was a willow covered with furry flower now
ripe and shedding its golden pollen.  The soft air
scattered the delicate yellow dust over the girl's hair
and neck and shoulders, a minute golden powder, but
she noticed it not.  The warm air played caressingly
with some of her dark hair, and the sun brought out
its copper glow—she was unaware of all.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A little blue butterfly flickered above her and lighted
on her head, it lay so still that the insect had no fear.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then a hand shook the gate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Gone to sleep, girl?' asked a female voice.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah looked up dreamily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A young, handsome, and dashing lady before her,
in white and carnation, a crimson feather in her hat,
and carmine in her cheeks.  Mehalah slowly recognised
Admonition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Pettican looked curiously at her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Who are you?—Oh!  I know, the girl Sharland!'
and she laughed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah put her hand to the latch to open the gate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You need not trouble,' said Admonition: 'I want
nothing from you.  I have heard of you.  You are the
young person,' with an affected cough, 'whom Master
Rebow has taken to live with him I think.  You had
the assurance once to come to my dear husband, and to
pester him.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He was kind to me,' said Mehalah to herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh yes, he was very kind indeed.  He did not
know much of you then.  Report had not made him
familiar with your name.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah looked moodily at her.  It was of no use
pretending to misunderstand her.  It was of no use
resenting the insinuation.  She sullenly bore the blow
and suffered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I have come here on your behalf,' said Admonition,
speaking to her across the gate.  She had the gate half
open, and kept it between them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You have nothing to do with me, or I with you,'
said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh! nothing, I am respectable.  I keep myself up,
I look after my character!' sneered Mrs. Pettican.
'Nevertheless I am here with an offer from my husband.
He is ready to receive your mother into his house; I do
not approve of this, but he is perverse and will have
his way.  He will take her in and provide for her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah looked up.  A load was being lifted from
her heart.  Were her mother taken in by Mr. Pettican,
then she could leave, and leave for ever, Red Hall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.  He admits his relationship,' said Admonition.
'I would not, were I he, now that the name
is—well—not so savoury as it was.  But he is not particular.
Men are not.  I have been brought up, I am thankful
to say, with very strict ideas, and have been formed in
a school quite other from that of Mr. Pettican.
However, as I was observing—you need not come near
me—keep the gate between us, please.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You were saying,' anxiously repeated Mehalah, who
had stepped forward in her eagerness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I was saying that Mr. Pettican will overlook a
great deal, and will receive your mother into his house,
and provide her with all that is necessary.  But
you——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I,' repeated Mehalah, breathlessly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You must never, never set foot within my doors.
I could not allow it.  I am a person of respectability,
I value proprieties.  I could not allow my house to be
spoken of as one which admitted—' with a contemptuous
shrug.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah took no notice of the insult.  She looked
hard at Admonition, and said gravely, 'You will shelter
and care for my mother, on condition that I never go
near her.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I may never see her, never speak to her, never kiss
her again.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, I could not suffer you to enter my respectable
house.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Not even if she were dying?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'My character would not allow of it.  The
respectability of my house must be maintained.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah thought for awhile.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot make up my mind at once,' she said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It will be a great relief to you to get rid of your
mother.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes, immeasurable.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I thought as much!' with a toss of the head, and
curl of the lip.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah did not give attention to these marks of
contempt.  Presently she asked, 'And who will attend
to my mother?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I will.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'</span><em class="italics">You!</em><span>' exclaimed Glory, with a flash of her old
indignation.  '</span><em class="italics">You</em><span>, who neglect and illtreat the husband
who lifted you out of the gutter.  You who have not
gratitude and generosity to the man to whom you owe
your position and comforts!  How would you treat a
poor, helpless, aged woman trusting to your mercy
unconditioned, when the man who bound you to him by
most solemn and sacred promises is insulted, and
neglected, and degraded by you?  No, never.  My mother
shall never, never be left to you of all women in the
world.  Never, never, never!' she beat her hand on the
gate.  'Let me bear my burden, let it crush me, but
she shall not be taken from me and die of neglect and
cruel treatment.  I can bear!' she raised herself with a
poor effort of her old energy, 'I will bear all for her.
She once bore with me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Drab!' hissed Admonition, and she flung past her,
shaking the gate furiously as she went by.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was with carnation in her cheek as well as in her
dress and hat that she appeared before Mrs. De Witt
and Elijah Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt drew back to let Mrs. Pettican in.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I think you was passing out,' said the latter;
'madam, your servant.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Your servant, madam,' from Mrs. De Witt, still
lingering.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now then, one at a time.  Aunt, go out and shut
the door,' said Rebow peremptorily, and the old woman
was obliged to obey.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What has brought you here?' asked Elijah surlily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Pettican looked round, then drew nearer.  'I
think,' she said, 'you once advised me something, but
I don't know how far your interest is the same as it was.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What do you mean?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I don't know whether you would be satisfied to
get Mehalah Sharland off your hands now, or keep her
here.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She remains here, she never shall leave it.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is just this,' said Admonition.  'My husband
has of late been plucking up a little courage, or showing
obstinacy.  My cousin Timothy—I don't know what to
make of him—he is not what he was.  He is always
making some excuse or other to get away, and I find
he goes to Mersea.  He hasn't been as dutiful and
amiable to me of late, as I have a right to expect,
considering how I have found him in food and drink and
tobacco, the best of all, and no stint.  There's some
game up between him and my husband, and I believe
it is this, I know it is this.  Charles is bent on getting
Mrs. Sharland and her daughter, the latter especially,
to come and live with him and take care of him.  He
dares to say I neglect him.  He reckons on pitting that
girl against me, he thinks that she would be more than
a match for me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'He thinks right,' burst in Rebow with a laugh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I won't have her in the house.  I don't mind
taking in the old woman, but the daughter I will not
admit.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You are right.  She'd master you and make you
docile or drive you out,' jeered Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She shall not come.  I have told her so.  I will
not be opposed and brow-beaten in my own house.  I
will not have the care of my husband wrested from me.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Have you come here to tell me this?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I know that Charles and Timothy have put their
heads together.  They are both up in rebellion against
me, and Timothy has walked over to Mersea to get a
boat and row here to invite that girl to come with her
mother to Wyvenhoe, and take up their abode with my
husband.  Charles promises if they will do so to provide
for them and leave them everything in his will, so as to
make them independent at my cost.  When I got wind
of this—I overheard the scheme by the merest accident—I
got a gig and was driven over to Salcott, and the
boy has put up the horse at the inn, and I walked on.
I will stop this little game.  The girl shall not come
inside the house.  If she puts in her little finger, her
fist will follow, and I will be driven out, though I am
the lawful wife of Charles Pettican.  I don't know what
Timothy means by aiding and abetting him in this.  I
will have it out with him, and that very soon.  I want
to know what are your views.  I have been pretty plain
with mine.  You may help me or hinder me, but I
hope I shall be able to keep my door locked against
such as that girl, and if Timothy thinks to flirt along
with her under my roof, and before my face, he is vastly
mistaken.  That husband of mine is deeper than I
suspected, or he would not have come over Timothy and
got him to aid him in this.  But I see it all.  Timothy
thinks if the girl gets there, and is to have Charles'
money, he will make up to her, marry her, and share
the plunder.  If that be his game he has left me out
of his calculations.  Timothy is a fool, or he would not
have gone over from me to Charles.  I'll have the matter
out here——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Not in this room,' said Elijah.  'There's rows
enough go on in here without your making another.
Set your mind at rest: Glory does not leave this house.
But I advise you to see your cousin, and, if possible,
prevent him from making the proposal.  If she hears
it, she will be off to-morrow, and carry her mother with
her; and then there may be trouble to you and me to
get her back.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She shall not come across my doorstep.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I tell you if once she hears that the chance is given
her, she will go, and not you nor a legion of such as you
could keep her out.  Go upstairs and go straight on till
you come to a door.  Go in there; it is the bedroom of
Glory and her mother.  Never mind the old fool—she
is sick and in bed.  You will find a small room or
closet beyond, with a three-cornered window in it.
Look out of that.  It commands the whole bay, and
you will see a boat, if it approaches the Hall.  There's
Sunken island and Cobb marsh between you and Mersea
City.  You will see a boat creep through one of the
creeks of Cobb marsh into Virley flat, and that will be
the boat with your cousin in it.  If you come down
then you will meet him as he lands.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As soon as Admonition had rushed past Mehalah
the girl walked away from the gate and ascended the
sea-wall.  She could obtain peace nowhere.  She could
hide nowhere, be nowhere without interruption.  She
saw Mrs. De Witt depart, and thought that now she
could sit on the wall and remain unmolested.  But
again was she disturbed, this time by old Abraham.
He was at the near landing-stage, just come from the
Ray—the landing-place employed when tides were full.
'Hark ye, mistress,' said the shepherd.  'I've had much
on my tongue this many a day, but you haven't given
me the chance to spit it out.  I won't be put off any
longer.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not answer or move away.  The reaction
after the momentary kindling of hope and burst of
passion had set in, and she had relapsed into her now
wonted mood.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is of no use, mistress, your going on as you are,'
continued the old man.  'Wherever he is, the master
speaks of you as no man ought to speak save of his
wife; and all the world knows you are not that.  What
are you, then?  You are in a false position, and that is
one of your own making.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You know it is not, Abraham.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I know it is one you could step out of to-morrow
if you chose,' he said.  'The master has offered you
your right place.  As long as you refuse to take it so
long everybody will be turned against you, and you
against everybody.  You keep away from everybody
because you shame to see them and be seen by them.
I know you don't like the master, but that's no reason
why you shouldn't take him.  Beggars mustn't be
choosers.  He is not as young and handsome as George
De Witt, but he is not such a fool, and he has his
pockets well lined, which the other had not.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It is of no use your saying this to me, Abraham,'
said Mehalah sadly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No, it is not,' pursued the dogged old man.  'Here
you must stick as long as your mother lives, and she
may live yet a score of years.  Creaky gates last longest.
Why, she ain't as old as I, and there's a score of years'
work in me yet.  How can you spend twenty years here
along of the master, with all the world talking?  It
will shame you to your grave, or brazen you past
respect.  This state of things can't do good to
anybody.  You must take him, and set yourself right with
the world, or go from here.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I cannot get away.  Would to heaven I could!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then you must marry him.  There is no escape
from it, for your own sake.  Why, girl,' the shepherd
went on, 'if you was his wife you would have a lawful
right and place here—this house, these marshes, these
cattle would be yours.  You would not be dependent
on him for anything; you would hold them as a right.
Now he can have you and your mother in prison at any
time, for you are still his tenants and owe him rent for
the Ray.  But if you marry him, you cut away his
power: he can't proceed against you and your mother
for one penny.  You would cancel the debt, do away
with the obligation.  If you was to marry him, and
saw your way clear, I fancy you might go away at any
time, and he would have no hold on you.  Now he has
you fast by this claim.  And now your character is
being ruined by association with him.  There,'
continued the old man, 'I doubt I never said so much
afore; but I have known you since you was a girl, and
I no more like to see you going to the bad than I like to
see a field that has been well tilled allowed to be overrun
with thistles, or a sheep lie down in the fen and die of
rot that might have been saved with a little ointment
stuck on in proper time.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah made no response.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I dare say it stings.' said Dowsing.  'I've seen
sheep jump with pain when the copperas comes against
a raw; but that's better than to lie down and rot away
without an effort, and without a word, as you are
doing now.'  He gave her a nod, and went on his way.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah stepped into his boat and seated herself in
her usual manner, with her head in her arms, and sank
into her wonted torpor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now, then, young woman!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Again interrupted, again aroused.  There was no
rest for her that day.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Jump on land, will you, young woman, and let this
lass step into your boat and get ashore without having
to go into the mud.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Timothy! that is Mehalah!' exclaimed Phoebe
Musset.  She was in the boat with Admonition's cousin.
'I'd rather you carried me.  I do not want to be obliged
to her for anything.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah stepped from her boat upon the turf, and
held out her hand mechanically to assist the girl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Don't hold out your hand to me!' screamed Phoebe.
'I wouldn't touch it.  Keep to yourself, if you please,
and let me pass.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Why, Phoebe!' exclaimed Timothy, 'what is the
matter?  I have come here to see this girl.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What!—to see Mehalah—or Glory, as you sailor
and fisher fellows like to call her?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Yes.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then I'm ashamed to have come with you,' said
Phoebe, pouting.  'You offered me a nice little row on
the water, and the sun was so bright, and the air so
warm, and you were so agreeable, that I ventured; but
I would not have stepped into the boat had I known you
were coming to visit another young woman, and she
one of so smirched a character.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Phoebe!  For shame!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'For shame!' repeated the girl turning on Timothy.
'For shame to you, to bring me here with you when you
are visiting this——'  She eyed Mehalah from head to
foot with studied insolence, and sniffed.  'I know her.
A bad, spiteful cat! always running after fellows.  She
tried to wheedle poor George De Witt into marrying
her.  When he was lost, she burnt her house and flung
herself on the mercy, into the arms, of Rebow.  Now, I
suppose, she is setting her red cap at you.  Oh! where
is the cap gone, eh?' turning to Mehalah as she skipped
ashore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Timothy was fastening the boat to that of Dowsing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah's wrath was rising.  She had endured
much that day—more than she could well bear.  The
impertinence of this malicious girl was intolerable
altogether.  She turned away to leave her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Stop! stop!' shouted Timothy.  'I have come
here with a message to you.  I have come here expressly
to see you.  I picked up Miss Musset on the way——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You picked me up just to amuse me till you found
Glory!' screamed Phoebe.  'Now you pitch me overboard,
as that savage treated me once.  I will not stand
this.  Timothy, come back this instant!  Row me back
to Mersea.  I have not come here to be insulted.  I
will not speak another word with you unless you——'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'For heaven's sake,' cried Timothy, tearing down
the sea-wall and jumping into the boat, 'come in,
Phoebe, at once, or I shall be off and leave you!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is the matter now?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He had his knife out, and was hacking through the
cord that attached his boat to Dowsing's.  In another
moment he was rowing as hard as he could down the
creek.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Admonition appeared on the wall.  Timothy had
detected her crossing the marsh, and fled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She turned in fury on Phoebe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah withdrew to the windmill, away from their
angry voices, and remained sitting by the sea till the
shadows of evening fell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then she returned, a fixed determination in her
face, which was harder and more moody than before.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She walked deliberately to the hall, opened the door,
and stepped in.  Elijah was there, crouched over the
empty hearth, as though there was a fire on it.  He
looked up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, Glory?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her bosom heaved.  She could not speak.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You have something to say,' he proceeded.  'Won't
the words come out?  Do they stick?'  His wild dark
eye was on her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Elijah,' she said, with burning brow and cheek, 'I
give up.  I will marry you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He gave a great shout and sprang up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Listen patiently to me,' she said, with difficulty
controlling her agitation.  'I will marry you, and take
your name, but only to save mine.  That is all.  I will
neither love you, nor live with you, save as I do now.
These are my terms.  If you will take them, so be it.
If not, we shall go on as before.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He laughed loudly, savagely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I told you, Glory, my own, own Glory, what must
be.  You would not come under my roof, but you came.
You would not marry me—now you submit.  You will
not love me—you must and shall.  Nothing can keep
us apart.  The poles are drawing together.  Perhaps
there may be a heaven for us both here.  But I do not
know.  Anyhow the sum is nearer the end than it was.
Glory, this day week you shall be my wife.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Virley Church has been already described, as far as its
external appearance goes.  The interior was even less
decent.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It possessed but one bell, which was tolled alike for
weddings and for funerals; there was a difference in
the pace at which it went for these distinct solemnities,
but that was all.  The bell produced neither a cheerful
nor a lugubrious effect on either occasion, as it was
cracked.  The dedication of Virley Church is unknown—no
doubt because it never had a patron; or if it had,
the patron disowned it.  No saint in the calendar could
be associated with such a church and keep his character.
St. Nicholas is the patron of fishers, St. Giles of
beggars, but who among the holy ones would spread
his mantle over worshippers who were smugglers or
wreckers?  When we speak of worshippers we use an
euphemism; for though the church sometimes contained
a congregation, it never held one of worshippers.
Salcott and Virley, the Siamese-twin parishes, connected
by a wooden bridge, embraced together five hundred
souls.  There were two churches, but few churchgoers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On the day of which we write, however, Virley
Church was full to overflowing.  This is not saying
much, for Virley Church is not bigger than a stable
that consists of two stalls and a loose box, whereof the
loose box represents the chancel.  When the curate in
charge preached from the pulpit—the rectors of the
two parishes were always non-resident—they kept a
curate between them—he was able to cuff the boys
in the west gallery who whispered, cracked nuts, or
snored.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The bellringer stood in the gallery, and had much
ado to guard his knuckles from abrasion against the
ceiling at each upcast of the rope.  He managed to
save them when tolling for a burial, but when the
movement was double-quick for a wedding his knuckles
came continually in contact with the plaster; and when
they did an oath, audible throughout the sacred
building, boomed between the clangours of the bell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Virley Church possessed one respectable feature, a
massive chancel-arch, but that gaped; and the pillars
slouched back against the wall in the attitude of the
Virley men in the village street waiting to insult the
women as they went by.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On either side of the east window hung one table of
the Commandments, but a village humourist had erased
all the 'nots' in the Decalogue; and it cannot be
denied that the parishioners conscientiously did their
utmost to fulfil the letter of the law thus altered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The congregation on Sundays consisted chiefly of
young people.  The youths who attended divine worship
occupied the hour of worship by wafting kisses to the
girls, making faces at the children, and scratching ships
on the paint of the pews.  Indeed, the religious
services performed alternately at the two churches might
have been discontinued, without discomposure to any,
had not traditional usage consecrated them to the
meeting of young couples.  The 'dearly beloveds' met
in the Lord's house every Lord's day to acknowledge
their 'erring and straying like lost sheep' and make
appointments for erring and straying again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The altar was a deal table, much wormeaten, with
a box beneath it.  The altar possessed no cover save
the red cotton pocket-handkerchief of the curate cast
occasionally across it.  The box contained the battered
Communion plate, an ironmoulded surplice with high
collar, a register-book, the pages glued together with
damp, and a brush and pan.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Communion rails had rotted at the bottom;
and when there was a Communion the clerk had to
caution the kneelers not to lean against the balustrade,
lest they should be precipitated upon the sanctuary floor.
No such controversy as that which has of late years
agitated the Church of England relative to the position
of the celebrant could have affected Virley, for the floor
in the midst, before the altar, had been eaten through
by rats, emerging from an old grave, and exposed
below gnawed and mouldy bones a foot beneath the
boards.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A marriage without three 'askings' was a novelty
in Salcott and Virley sufficient to excite interest in the
place; and when that marriage was to take place
between one so well known and dreaded as Elijah Rebow
and a girl hardly ever seen, but of whom much was
spoken, it may well be supposed that Virley Church
was crowded with sightseers.  The gallery was full to
bursting.  Sailor-boys in the front amused themselves
with dropping broken bits of tobacco-pipe on the heads
below, and giggling at the impotent rage of those they
hit.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was a sweep in Salcott, who tenanted a tottering
cottage, devoid of furniture.  The one room was
heaped with straw, and into this the sweep crept at
night for his slumbers.  This man now appeared at the
sacred door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look out, blackie!' shouted those near; 'we are
not going to be smutted by you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then make way for your superiors.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Superiors!' sneered a matron near.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Well, I am your superior,' said the sweep, 'for my
proper place is poking out at the top of a chimney, and
yours is poking into the fire at the bottom.  Make way.
I have a right to see as well as the best of you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The crowd contracted on either side in anxiety for
their clothes, and the sweep worked his way to the
fore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I'll have the best place of you all,' he said, as the
gods in the gallery received him with ironical cries of
'Sweep! sweep!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He charged into the chancel, and sent his black
legs over the Communion rails.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At some remote period the chancel of Virley had
fallen, and had been rebuilt, with timber and bricks on
the old walls left to the height of two feet above the
floor.  As the old walls were four feet thick, and the
new walls only the thickness of one brick, the chancel
was provided with a low seat all round it, like the
</span><em class="italics">cancellæ</em><span> of an ancient basilica.  The sweep, with a
keen eye peering through his soot, had detected this
seat and seen that it was unappropriated.  He was over
the altar with a second jump, and had seated himself
behind it, facing west, in the post of dignity occupied
in the Primitive Church by the bishop, with his legs
under the table, and his elbows on it, commanding the
best view attainable of everything that went on, or that
would go on, in the church.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>His example was followed at once.  A rush of boys
and men was made for the chancel; the railings fell
before them, and they seized and appropriated the
whole of the low seat that surrounded the sanctuary.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I've the best place now, you lubbers,' said the
sweep.  'I shall have them full in face, and see the
blushes of the bride.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'They are a-coming! they are a-coming!' was
repeated through the church.  A boy peering out of
the window that lighted the gallery had seen the
approach of the procession from Red Hall over the
wooden bridge.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In came the Reverend Mr. Rabbit, very hot and
sneezy—he laboured under hay fever all the blooming
time of the year.  He got to the altar.  The clerk
dived into the box and rose to the surface with the
register-book and the surplice.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Where is the ink?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Here is a pen,' said the clerk, producing one with
nibs parted like the legs of the Colossus of Rhodes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'But we shall want ink.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'There is a bottle somewhere in the box,' said the
clerk.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Never mind if there ain't,' observed one of the
elders seated by the table; 'there is the sweep here
handy, and you have only to mix a bit of his smut with
the tears of the bride.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Shut that ugly trap of yours,' said the
chimney-cleaner.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It may be ugly,' retorted the humourist, 'but it is
clean.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Here they are!' from the gallery.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Make way!' shouted Mrs. De Witt, battering
about her with her umbrella.  'How are people to get
married if you stuff up the door, as though caulking a
leak?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She drove her way in.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now, then,' said she, 'come on, Mistress Sharland.
Dear soul alive! how unmannerly these Virley people
are!  They want some of us from Mersea to come and
teach them manners.  Now, then, young Spat!' she
shouted to a great boy in a fishing guernsey, 'do you
want your head combing?  Do you see what you have
done to my best silk gown?  What do you mean
coming to a house of worship in mud-splashers?[1]  Are
you come here after winkles?'</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="noindent pfirst"><span class="small">[1] Wooden paddles, worn by those who go out 'winkling'

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>'I ain't got my splashers on,' said the boy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then you have feet as big and as dirty as paddles.
You have trodden on my best silk and took it out at
the gathers.'  Then, turning and looking through the
door behind her, she waved her umbrella with a proud
flourish.  'Come on, hearties!  I've cleared the way.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She put her shoulder to the crowd and wedged her
way further ahead.  'Ah!' she said, 'here are a lot of
sniggering girls.  If all was known what ought to be
known some of you ought to be getting married to-day.
Leave off your laughing up there!' gesticulating
towards the boys in the loft.  'Don't you know yet how
to behave in a place of worship?  I have a great mind
to draw my </span><em class="italics">Pandora</em><span> up at Virley hard and settle here
and teach you.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mehalah came in, pale, with sunken eyes, that
burned with feverish brightness.  A hectic flush dyed
her cheeks.  Her lips were set and did not tremble.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After having given her promise, under conditions,
to Rebow she had neither slept nor eaten.  She had
abandoned her habit of retiring to the shore to sit and
brood, and maintained instead incessant activity.  When
she had done what was necessary for others she made
work for herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Sharland had forgotten her ague and left her
bed in the excitement and pleasure of her daughter's
submission.  She had attempted several times to speak
to Mehalah of her approaching marriage, but had not
been able to wring a word out of her.  From the
moment Glory gave her consent to Rebow she said not
another syllable on the subject to him or to anyone.
She became more taciturn and retiring, if possible,
than before.  Abraham Dowsing had saluted her and
attempted a rough congratulation.  She had turned
her back and walked away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah's conduct was the reverse of Glory's.  His
gloom was gone, and had made way for boisterous and
demonstrative joy.  His pride was roused, and he
insisted on the marriage preparations being made on a
liberal scale.  He threw a purse into Mrs. Sharland's
lap, and bade her spend it how she liked on Mehalah's
outfit and her own.  The old woman had been supremely
happy in arranging everything, her happiness only
dashed by the unsympathetic conduct of one chief
performer in the ceremony, her daughter, whom she
could not interest in any point connected with it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There had been a little struggle that morning.
Mehalah had drawn on her blue 'Gloriana' jersey as
usual, and Mrs. Sharland had insisted on its coming off.
The girl had submitted after a slight resistance, and
had allowed herself passively to be arrayed as her
mother chose.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah was dressed in a blue coat, with brass buttons,
and knee-breeches.  No one had seen him so spruce
before.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I say, dame,' whispered Farmer Goppin to his
wife, 'the master of Red Hall is turning over a new
leaf to-day.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Maybe,' she answered, 'but I doubt it will be a
blank one.  Look at the girl.  It won't be a gay[2] for
him.'</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="noindent pfirst"><span class="small">[2] Essex for 'Picture.'</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>'Move on!' said Mrs. De Witt.  'I'll keep the road.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt had come at Rebow's special request.
She had put on for the occasion her silk dress, in which
she had gone from home and been married.  Her figure
had altered considerably through age and maternity,
and the dress was now not a little too tight for her.
Her hooking together had been a labour of difficulty,
performed by Mrs. Sharland at Red Hall; it had been
beyond her own unassisted powers, in the </span><em class="italics">Pandora</em><span>,
when she drew on the ancient dress.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Dear Sackalive!' exclaimed Mrs. De Witt when
she extracted the garment from the lavender in which
it had lain, like a corpse in balm, for some five-and-twenty
years, 'I was a fool when I last put you on;
and I won't fit myself out in you again for the same
purpose, unless I am driven to it by desperate
circumstances.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Unable to make the body meet, she had thrown a
smart red coat over it; and having engaged a boy to row
her to Red Hall, sat in the stern, with her skirt pinned
over her head, as though the upper part of her person
were enveloped in a camera lucida; in which she was
viewing in miniature the movements of the outer world.
On reaching Red Hall she had thrown off the scarlet,
and presented her back pleadingly to Mrs. Sharland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I ought not to have done it, but I did,' said she
in a tone of confidence.  'I mean I oughtn't to have
put this gown on, last time I wore it,' she explained
when Mrs. Sharland inquired her meaning.  'It was
thus it came about: I was intimate with the sister of
Moses De Witt, and one Mersea fair I went over to the
merrymakings, and she inwited me to take a mouthful
with her and her brother on board the </span><em class="italics">Pandora</em><span>.  I
went, and I liked the looks of the wessel, and of Moses,
so I said to him, "You seem wery comfortable here,
and I think I could make myself comfortable here too.
So, if you are noways unobjectionable, I think I will
stay."  And I did.  I put on my silk gown, and was
married to Moses, in spite of all my parents said, and
I turned the sister of De Witt out and took her place.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt felt great restraint in the silk gown.
Her arms were like wings growing out of her shoulderblades.
She was not altogether satisfied that the hooks
would hold, and therefore carried to church with her
the military coat, over her arm.  She wore her hair
elaborately frizzled.  She had done it with the stove
poker, and had worn it for some days in curl-papers.
Over this was a broad white chip hat, tied under her
chin with skyblue ribands, and she had inserted a sprig
of forget-me-nots inside the frizzle of hair over her
forehead.  'Bless my soul,' she said to herself, 'the
boys will go stark staring mad of love at the sight of
me.  I look like a pretty miss of fifteen—I do, by
Cock!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. De Witt succeeded in bringing her party
before the altar, at which still sat the sweep, deaf to
the feeble expostulations of the curate, which he had
listened to with one eye closed and his red tongue
hanging out of the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mr. Rabbit was obliged to content himself with a
protest, and vest himself hastily for the function.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Look here,' said Mrs. De Witt, who took on herself
the office of master of the ceremonies: 'I am not
going to be trodden on and crumpled.  Stand back,
good people; stand back, you parcel of unmannerly
cubs!  Let me get where I can keep the boys in order
and see that everything gives satisfaction.  I have
been married; I ought to know all the ways and
workings of it, and I do.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She thrust her way to the pulpit, ascended the
stair, and installed herself therein.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Oh, my eye!' whispered the boys in the gallery.
'The old lady is busted all down her back!'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'What is that?' asked Mrs. De Witt in dismay.
She put her hands behind her.  The observation of the
boys was just.  Her efforts to clear a way had been
attended with ruin to the fastenings of her dress, and
had brought back her arms to their normal position at
the expense of hooks-and-eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It can't be helped,' said Mrs. De Witt, 'so here
goes!'  And she drew on her military coat to hide the
wreck.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now, then, parson, cast off!  Elijah, you stand on
the right, and Glory on the left.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The curate sneezed violently and rubbed his nose,
and then his inflamed eyes.  The dust of the flowering
grass got even into that mouldy church, rank with
grave odours and rotting timber.  He began with the
Exhortation.  Mrs. De Witt followed each sentence
with attention and appropriate gesture.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'"Is not to be enterprised nor taken in hand
unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly,"' she repeated, with
solemn face and in an awestruck whisper; then, poking
the boys in the gallery with her umbrella, 'Just you
listen to that, you cubs!'  Then she nodded and
gesticulated at the firstly, secondly, and thirdly of the
address to those whom she thought needed impressing
with the solemn words.  Elijah answered loudly to the
questions asked him whether he would have the girl at
his side to be his wedded wife.  Her answer was faint
and reluctantly given.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?"'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was a pause.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Speak up, Mistress Sharland, speak up!' said
Mrs. De Witt in a tone of authority.  'Or, if you don't
speak, curtsey.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The curate was affected with a violent sneezing fit.
When he recovered he went on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow clasped Mehalah's hand firmly, and firmly
repeated the sentences after the priest.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'"I, Elijah, take thee——"' began the curate;
then asked, in a whisper, 'What is the bride's name?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Mehalah,' answered the mother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'"I, Elijah, take thee, Mehalah, to my wedded
wife,"' began the curate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'"I, Elijah, take thee, Glory, to my wedded wife,"'
repeated Rebow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'That is not the name,' protested Mr. Rabbit.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'I marry Glory, and no one else; I take her by
that name and by none other,' said Rebow.  'Go on.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Say the words after me,' the curate whispered to
Mehalah, who began to tremble.  She obeyed, but
stopped at the promise 'to love, cherish, and to obey.'
The curate repeated it again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"To obey,"' said Mehalah.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mr. Rabbit looked uncertain how to act.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'"To love, cherish, and obey,"' he suggested
faintly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Go on,' ordered Rebow.  'Let her obey now; the
rest will come in due season.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The priest nervously submitted.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Now for the ring,' said the clerk.  'Put it on the
book.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rebow was taken by surprise.  'By heaven!' he
said, 'I forgot all about that.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'You must have something to use for the purpose,'
said the curate.  'Have you no ring of your own?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'No.  Am I like to have?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'Then let her mother lend her her own marriage-ring.'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'She shall not,' said Rebow angrily.  'No, no!
Glory's marriage with me is not a second-hand affair,
and like that of such fools as she,' pointing to
Mrs. Sharland.  'No, we shall use a ring such as has never
been used before, because our union is unlike all other
unions.  Will this do?' He drew the link of an iron
chain from his pocket.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'This is a link broke off my brother's fetters.  I
picked it up on the sea-wall this morning.  Will it do?'</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>'It must do for want of a better,' said the curate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Elijah threw it on the book; then placed it on
Mehalah's finger, with a subdued laugh.  'Our bond,
Glory,' he said, in a low tone, 'is not of gold, but of
iron.'</span></p>
